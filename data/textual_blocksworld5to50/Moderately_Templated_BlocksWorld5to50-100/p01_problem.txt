As initial conditions I have that, block1 is clear, the hand is empty, block1 is on top of block3, block3 is on top of block5, block4 is on top of block2, block5 is on top of block4, and block2 is on the table.
My goal is to have that block1 is on the table, block2 is on the table, block3 is on the table, block4 is on the table, and block5 is on the table.
