As initial conditions I have that, block2 is clear, block4 is clear, block5 is clear, the hand is empty, block2 is on top of block3, block5 is on top of block1, block1 is on the table, block3 is on the table, and block4 is on the table.
My goal is to have that block1 is on top of block2, block2 is on top of block5, block4 is on top of block3, block5 is on top of block4, and block3 is on the table.
