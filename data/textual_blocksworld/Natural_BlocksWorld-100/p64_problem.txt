You have 12 blocks arranged in a specific way on the table. Currently, Block 8 is directly on the table. Block 10 is also on the table, with Block 9 placed on top of it. Block 2 is stacked on Block 9, followed by Block 1 on top of Block 2. Block 11 is on Block 1, with Block 12 on top of Block 11, followed by Block 5 and Block 6 at the very top. Block 4 is on the table as well, and Block 7, which is also on the table, has Block 3 stacked on it. Your arm is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration. Specifically, Block 3 should be on the table with Block 11 on top of it, followed by Block 10, and then Block 7 at the very top. Block 4 and Block 5 should each be on the table, with Block 12 on top of Block 5. Block 1 and Block 2 should also be on the table, with Block 9 placed on Block 2, and Block 8 on top of Block 9. Finally, Block 6 should be on the table.
