Imagine you have 12 blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 10 is sitting on the table with Block 1 on top of it. Separately, Block 5 is on the table with Block 4 stacked on it, and Block 2 is on top of Block 4. Block 7 and Block 9 are both directly on the table. Block 6 is on top of Block 9. Block 3 is on the table, with Block 8 on top of it, followed by Block 11, and finally, Block 12 at the top of this stack. Your arm is free and you need to reorganize the blocks. The goal is to arrange them so that Block 11 is directly on the table, with Block 10 on top of it. Blocks 1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 9, 4, 6, 2, and 12 should each also be placed directly on the table.
