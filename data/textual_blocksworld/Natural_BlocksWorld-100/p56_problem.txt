In this Blocksworld game, you start with six blocks arranged as follows: Block 3 is sitting on the table. Block 6 is stacked on Block 3, with Block 5 on top of Block 6. Block 4 is placed on Block 5, and Block 1 is on Block 4. Lastly, Block 2 is positioned on top of Block 1. Your arm is currently empty. Your objective is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Place Block 1 and Block 2 directly on the table, put Block 6 on top of Block 2, and place Block 4 directly on the table with Block 3 on top of it. Finally, Block 5 should also be placed directly on the table.
