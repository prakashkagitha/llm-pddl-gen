In the Blocksworld game, you start with 11 blocks arranged as follows: Block 9 is on the table with Block 3 on top of it, Block 1 is directly on the table, Block 10 is also on the table, and Block 11 is on the table with Block 4 on top of it. Block 2 is on the table with Block 8 on top, followed by Block 7 on top of Block 8. Block 5 and Block 6 are both directly on the table. Your task is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 4 should be on the table, followed by Block 2 and Block 3. Block 5 should then be placed on top of Block 3. Block 10 remains on the table, with Block 8 on top of it and Block 11 on top of Block 8. Meanwhile, Block 1 and Block 6 stay on the table, followed by Block 9 with Block 7 on top of it. Your arm is empty to begin with.
