You are playing a game called Blocksworld, where you need to rearrange a set of blocks into a specific configuration. Currently, you have 12 blocks arranged as follows: Block 7, Block 9, Block 4, Block 6, Block 12, Block 8, Block 2, and Block 3 are on the table. Block 5 is stacked on top of Block 4, and Block 11 is stacked on top of Block 5. Block 1 is on top of Block 10, which itself is on the table. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 12 and Block 9 should remain on the table, with Block 11 placed on top of Block 9 and Block 3 on top of Block 11. Block 4 should stay on the table with Block 6 on top of it, followed by Block 10, Block 1, and Block 7 stacked in that order. Then, Block 5 should be placed on top of Block 7, with Block 8 on top of Block 5, and Block 2 on top of Block 8. Initially, your arm is empty, and you need to achieve the target configuration using permissible moves in the game.
