In the Blocksworld game, you begin with 15 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Initially, Block 6 is on the table with Block 3 on top of it. Block 5 rests on Block 3. Separately, Block 11 and Block 14 are also on the table. Block 8 is placed on Block 14, with Block 7 on Block 8, followed by Block 9 on Block 7. Block 4 is on Block 9, and Block 15 is on Block 4. On top of Block 15 is Block 12, then Block 2 on Block 12, and Block 13 on Block 2. Block 10 is placed on Block 13. Finally, Block 1 is directly on the table. You have an empty arm to move the blocks. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration. In this desired setup, Block 8 is on the table with Block 7 on top of it, followed by Block 12, Block 5, and Block 13 in that order. Block 15 is also on the table, with Block 4 on top of it. Block 3 is on the table as well, with Block 11 on it, followed by Block 2, Block 9, Block 14, and Block 10 in that sequence. Finally, Block 6 should be on Block 10, and Block 1 should rest on Block 6.
