In the Blocksworld game, you start with 8 blocks arranged in a certain way. Initially, Block 2 is directly on the table, with Block 6 placed on top of it, and Block 4 stacked on Block 6. Separately on the table, Block 3 stands alone, and so does Block 1. However, Block 5 is placed on Block 1, Block 7 is on Block 5, and Block 8 rests on top of Block 7. Your task is to rearrange the blocks to achieve a new configuration, where Block 5 is directly on the table with Block 6 on top of it, while Block 4, Block 1, Block 3, Block 7, Block 2, and Block 8 are all placed directly on the table individually. Your arm is free at the start.
