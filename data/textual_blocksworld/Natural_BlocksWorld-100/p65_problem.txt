In this Blocksworld game, you have a set of 8 blocks that start in a specific arrangement. Initially, Block 4, Block 7, and Block 5 are on the table. Block 3 is stacked on top of Block 5, and Block 6 is on top of Block 3. Block 2 is also on the table, with Block 8 stacked on top of it, and finally, Block 1 is on the table by itself.
