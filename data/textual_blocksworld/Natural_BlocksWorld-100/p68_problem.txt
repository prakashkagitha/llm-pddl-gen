In the Blocksworld game, you start with 9 blocks arranged like this: Block 5, Block 4, and Block 8 are all on the table. Block 6 is on top of Block 8. Block 7 and Block 1 are also on the table. Block 2 is sitting on Block 1, while Block 9 is on the table with Block 3 on top of it. You need to move these blocks to achieve the following configuration: Block 5 remains on the table, with Block 1 now on top of it. Block 4 stays on the table, and you stack Block 7 on top of Block 4. Next, place Block 6 on Block 7, and then Block 2 on Block 6. Continue by placing Block 3 on Block 2, and finally, put Block 9 on Block 3 and Block 8 on top of Block 9. Right now, your arm is empty and ready to move the blocks.
