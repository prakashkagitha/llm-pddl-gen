Imagine you have 13 blocks arranged in a specific order. Block 8 is sitting on the table. On top of Block 8, there is Block 10, followed by Block 7, then Block 2, then Block 3, then Block 13, then Block 4, then Block 6, then Block 12, then Block 11, then Block 9, then Block 1, and finally, Block 5 on top of all.
