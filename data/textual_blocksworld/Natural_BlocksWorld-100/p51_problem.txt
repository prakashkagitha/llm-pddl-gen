In the Blocksworld game, you start with 9 blocks arranged as follows: Block 7 is sitting on the table, with Block 2 on top of it. Block 9 is placed on Block 2, and Block 1 is stacked on Block 9. This continues with Block 4 on Block 1, Block 6 on Block 4, Block 5 on Block 6, Block 3 on Block 5, and finally, Block 8 on Block 3. The game begins with your arm empty. Your task is to reorganize the blocks into a new arrangement: Place Block 8 on the table first. Then, put Block 9 on top of Block 8. Next, place Block 2 on the table, with Block 4 stacked on Block 2 and Block 3 on Block 4. Continue by placing Block 7 on Block 3. Separately, place Block 6 on the table and Block 1 on the table as well, stacking Block 5 on top of Block 1. Achieving this new configuration is your goal.
