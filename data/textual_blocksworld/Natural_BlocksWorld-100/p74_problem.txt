You have 14 blocks arranged as follows: Block 12 is sitting on the table with Block 8 on top of it. Block 4 is on the table by itself. Block 6, Block 5, Block 7, Block 1, Block 13, Block 11, Block 9, and Block 3 are also individually resting on the table. On top of Block 3 is Block 14. Finally, Block 10 and Block 2 are each on the table. Your arm is currently empty. You need to rearrange the blocks to achieve a new configuration: Block 1, Block 10, Block 4, Block 9, Block 8, Block 6, Block 13, Block 14, Block 12, Block 11, Block 3, and Block 2 should all be on the table by themselves. Meanwhile, Block 7 should be placed on top of Block 6, and Block 5 should also be on the table.
