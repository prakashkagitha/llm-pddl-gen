In the Blocksworld game, you are given 15 blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 6 is on the table, with Block 11 on top of it. Block 4 is sitting on Block 11, and Block 12 is on Block 4. On top of Block 12, you'll find Block 7, which has Block 5 on it. Finally, Block 14 rests on Block 5. Separately, Block 3 is on the table with Block 1 on it, and Block 13 on top of Block 1. Another set has Block 2 on the table, with Block 9 on top of it. Additionally, Block 8 is on the table with Block 15 on it, and Block 10 on top of Block 15. Your arm is currently empty, meaning you can pick up blocks and move them around. You need to rearrange the blocks so that Block 14, Block 6, Block 11, Block 15, Block 3, Block 10, Block 4, Block 13, Block 5, Block 1, Block 8, Block 12, Block 9, and Block 7 are all on the table. Meanwhile, Block 2 should be placed on top of Block 5.
