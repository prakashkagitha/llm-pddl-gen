In the Blocksworld game, you start with 10 blocks arranged as follows: Blocks 3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 6, 1, 5, and 9 are all on the table. Block 8 is positioned on top of Block 10. You have an empty arm ready to move the blocks around. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into this configuration: Block 1 stays on the table. Block 5 remains on the table, with Block 7 placed on top of it. Block 8 should be on top of Block 7, followed by Block 4 on top of Block 8, and Block 2 on top of Block 4. Block 6 stays on the table, with Block 3 placed on Block 6, and then Block 9 on top of Block 3. Finally, Block 10 should be on the table.
