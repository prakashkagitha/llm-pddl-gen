The game involves 13 blocks labeled A through M. The initial configuration has blocks stacked in three separate towers as follows: Tower 1 has blocks A, B, and C, with A at the bottom, B in the middle, and C at the top. Tower 2 has blocks D, E, F, and G, with D at the bottom, E in the middle, F above E, and G at the top. Tower 3 has blocks H, I, J, K, and L, with H at the bottom, I above H, J above I, K above J, and L at the top. Block M is initially placed on the table as a standalone block. The goal of the game is to rearrange all the blocks to form a single tower with the blocks in the order from bottom to top as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M.
