In the Blocksworld game, you start with 8 blocks arranged in a specific way. Block 6 is currently on the table with Block 1 on top of it. Block 3 is also on the table with Block 2 on top of it. Block 8 is stacked on Block 2, and Block 5 is on Block 8. On top of Block 5 is Block 7, and Block 4 is on top of Block 7. Your arm is free to move blocks. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration where Block 3 is on the table with Block 8 placed on top of it. Block 4 should then be on Block 8, followed by Block 1 on Block 4. Block 2 should be placed on Block 1, then Block 7 on Block 2, Block 6 on Block 7, and finally, Block 5 should be on Block 6.
