In the Blocksworld game, we start with 15 blocks arranged as follows: Block 11 is placed on the table. On top of Block 11, there is Block 3. Block 10 is also on the table. Block 1 sits on the table as well. Additionally, Block 8, Block 12, and Block 15 are on the table. Block 5 is stacked on Block 15, followed by Block 6 on Block 5, and then Block 14 on Block 6. Block 9 is similarly on the table, with Block 4 on top of Block 9. Block 7 is on the table too, with Block 13 on it, and finally, Block 2 is on the table. Your arm is currently empty and ready to move blocks. The goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration: Block 8 should be on the table, with Block 12 on top of it, followed by Block 13 on Block 12, then Block 4 on Block 13, Block 2 on Block 4, Block 7 on Block 2, and Block 15 on Block 7. On top of Block 15, there should be Block 14. Separately, Block 3 should sit on the table with Block 6 on it, followed by Block 11, then Block 10 on Block 11, Block 5 on Block 10, and finally Block 9 on Block 5. Block 1 should remain on the table.
