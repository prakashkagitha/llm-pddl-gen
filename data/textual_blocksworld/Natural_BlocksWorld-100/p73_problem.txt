You're playing the Blocksworld game with 14 blocks currently arranged like this: Block 12, Block 10, and Block 13 are directly on the table. Block 6 is on Block 10, and Block 8 is on top of Block 6. Then, Block 2 rests on Block 13, followed by Block 9 on Block 2, and Block 7 on Block 9. Another set of blocks has Block 4 on the table, with Block 1 on Block 4, then Block 14 on Block 1, Block 5 on Block 14, and finally Block 3 on Block 5, with Block 11 on top of Block 3. Your arm is currently empty. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to the desired configuration: Block 13 on the table with Block 3 on top, then Block 10 on Block 3. Another set should have Block 4 on the table with Block 8 on top, followed by Block 11 on Block 8. Additionally, Block 6 should be on the table with Block 1 on top, then Block 7 on Block 1, followed by Block 2 on Block 7, Block 12 on Block 2, Block 9 on Block 12, Block 5 on Block 9, and finally Block 14 on top of Block 5.
