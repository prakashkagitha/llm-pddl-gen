The game begins with 15 blocks labeled A through O. Initially, the blocks are arranged with blocks A, B, and C stacked sequentially on the table with A on the bottom, B in the middle, and C at the top. Block D is on the table with blocks E and F stacked sequentially above it, making D at the bottom, E in the middle, and F at the top. Block G is placed alone on the table. Blocks H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O are also scattered individually on the table. The objective is to rearrange these blocks such that in the final configuration, block O is at the bottom with blocks N, M, L, and K stacked sequentially on top of it, and block J should be at the bottom with blocks I and H on top of it. Blocks A, B, C, D, E, F, and G should all be on the table without any block on top of them.
