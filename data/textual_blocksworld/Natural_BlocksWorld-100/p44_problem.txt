In this challenge, you begin with a setup of 9 blocks arranged as follows: Block 7, Block 5, and Block 8 are positioned directly on the table. Block 2 is resting on top of Block 8. Block 4 and Block 9 are also on the table. Additionally, Block 6 is stacked on Block 9, with Block 3 on top of Block 6 and Block 1 perched on Block 3. Your task starts with an empty hand, and your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration: Begin by placing Block 6 on the table. Next, position Block 9 on top of Block 6. Continue by stacking Block 1 on Block 9, followed by Block 2 on Block 1. Then, place Block 5 on top of Block 2 and Block 8 on Block 5. Proceed by putting Block 3 on Block 8, then stack Block 4 on Block 3, and finish by placing Block 7 on top of Block 4.
