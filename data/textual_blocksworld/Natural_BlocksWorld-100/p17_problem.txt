You are playing the Blocksworld game and are faced with a set of 13 blocks arranged in a specific way. Initially, Block 1, Block 3, Block 2, and Block 10 are directly on the table. Block 7 is stacked on Block 10, followed by Block 13 on top of Block 7, and Block 5 on top of Block 13. Block 9 is also on the table, with Block 8 on top of it, followed by Block 4 on Block 8, Block 12 on Block 4, Block 11 on Block 12, and finally, Block 6 sitting on Block 11. Your arm is currently empty. The objective is to rearrange all the blocks so that every single block, from Block 1 through Block 13, ends up on the table with no blocks stacked on top of each other.
