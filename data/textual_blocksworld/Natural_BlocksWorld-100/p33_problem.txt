In the Blocksworld game, you start with 10 blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 6 rests on the table, and Block 2 sits on top of Block 6. Block 8 is placed above Block 2, followed by Block 10 on Block 8, and finally, Block 3 on top of Block 10. Block 9 is directly on the table, as are Block 4 and Block 5. Block 1 is placed on Block 4, and Block 7 also rests on the table. Notably, your arm is free to move blocks around. Your objective is to reconfigure these blocks such that Block 9, Block 10, Block 3, Block 4, Block 7, Block 2, Block 5, Block 8, and Block 1 are all on the table. Additionally, Block 6 should be on top of Block 3.
