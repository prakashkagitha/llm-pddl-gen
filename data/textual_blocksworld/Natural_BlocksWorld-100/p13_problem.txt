In the Blocksworld game, you start with 13 blocks arranged in a specific way. The initial configuration is as follows: Block 3 is on the table, Block 13 is on top of Block 3, Block 8 is on Block 13, Block 6 is on Block 8, Block 11 is on Block 6, Block 5 is on Block 11, and Block 7 is on Block 5. Separately, Block 4 is on the table, Block 2 is on the table with Block 9 on it, and Block 12 is on the table with Block 10 on it and Block 1 on top of Block 10. Your arm is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks so that each block (Blocks 1 to 13) ends up individually on the table, with no blocks stacked on each other.
