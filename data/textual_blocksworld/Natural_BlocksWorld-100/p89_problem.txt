In this specific Blocksworld problem, there are 5 blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E initially arranged randomly on the table. The goal is to achieve the target configuration where Block A is on Block B, Block B is on Block C, Block C is on Block D, and Block D is on Block E, with Block E sitting on the table. Each block starts in a unique position, with Block A and Block B starting on the table, Block C on Block A, Block D on the table, and Block E on Block B. The rules of the game allow for only one action at a time, requiring strategic moves to achieve the objective configuration while adhering to the constraints of pick-up and placement actions.
