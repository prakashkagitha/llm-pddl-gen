In the current Blocksworld setup, you have 9 blocks arranged in a specific way. The blocks are configured as follows: Block 4 is sitting directly on the table, and Block 8 is also on the table with Block 1 stacked on top of it. Block 9 is on the table too, with Block 5 placed on top of it. Likewise, Block 3 is on the table with Block 2 on top of it, and Block 6 is positioned on top of Block 2, while Block 7 is atop Block 6. You are starting with an empty arm. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that each one is directly on the table. In the desired configuration, Blocks 6, 7, 3, 8, 1, 5, 9, 4, and 2 should all be individually placed on the table.
