You have six blocks in the following setup: Block 4 is resting on the table with Block 3 on top of it. Block 1 is also on the table. Block 6 sits on the table, bearing Block 2 on top. Block 5 is positioned on the table as well. Your arm is currently free. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 5 remains on the table, Block 1 stays on the table, Block 2 is placed on the table, and Block 3 is moved to sit directly on the table. Meanwhile, Block 4 should end up on top of Block 3, and Block 6 should still be on the table.
