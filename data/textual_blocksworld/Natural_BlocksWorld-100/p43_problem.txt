In the Blocksworld game, you start with 10 blocks arranged as follows: Block 3, Block 8, Block 10, Block 4, Block 6, Block 5, and Block 7 are all on the table. Block 1 is on top of Block 10, Block 2 is on top of Block 1, and Block 9 is on top of Block 6. You start with your arm empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 3, Block 6, Block 7, Block 2, Block 10, Block 5, Block 4, and Block 8 are on the table. Additionally, Block 1 should be on top of Block 8, and Block 9 should be on the table.
