In the Blocksworld game, you start with 14 blocks arranged individually on the table. Here is the initial configuration: Blocks 1 through 14 are all placed directly on the table, with no blocks stacked on each other. Additionally, your arm is currently empty. Your task is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following final configuration: Block 8 and Block 9 remain on the table, with Block 1 stacked on top of Block 9. Block 2 stays on the table as well, and you need to place Block 11 on top of Block 2, followed by Block 12 on Block 11, and then Block 13 on Block 12. After that, Block 3 should be placed on top of Block 13. For the remaining blocks, Block 7 should stay on the table with Block 4 on top of it. Similarly, Block 6 should be on the table with Block 14 on top of it. Finally, Block 5 should remain on the table with Block 10 placed on top of Block 5.
