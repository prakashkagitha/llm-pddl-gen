In the Blocksworld game, you have 14 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. The current setup is as follows: Block 5, Block 12, Block 11, Block 3, Block 7, Block 2, Block 10, Block 4, and Block 1 are on the table. Block 6 is stacked on top of Block 12, and Block 9 is on top of Block 6. Block 13 is placed on top of Block 11, with Block 14 on top of Block 13. Lastly, Block 8 is on Block 4. Your arm is currently empty. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 13, Block 10, Block 11, Block 4, Block 8, Block 12, Block 6, Block 9, Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, Block 5, and Block 7 are all placed directly on the table. The only exception is that Block 14 should be on top of Block 3.
