In the Blocksworld game, you start with 10 blocks arranged on a table in the following manner: Block 10, Block 3, Block 8, Block 2, Block 9, Block 4, Block 6, Block 5, Block 7, and Block 1 are all placed individually on the table. Your hand is empty. The objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve this final configuration: Block 1 remains on the table and Block 10 is placed on top of Block 1. Block 4 stays on the table, with Block 8 on top of it. Block 3 also remains on the table, supporting Block 9, which in turn supports Block 2. Block 5 stays on the table, and Block 6 should be placed on top of it, with Block 7 on top of Block 6.
