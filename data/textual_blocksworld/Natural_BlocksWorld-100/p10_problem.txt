You have a stack of 13 blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 10 is sitting directly on the table. Block 7 is on top of Block 10, and Block 1 is perched on Block 7. Block 12 is also on the table, with Block 11 on top of it, followed by Block 6. Another block on the table is Block 8, and Block 3 sits on top of it, with Block 5, Block 4, Block 13, Block 2, and Block 9 stacked respectively on top. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration. In the new setup, Block 7 should be directly on the table with Block 3 on top of it. Block 10, Block 8, Block 11, Block 6, Block 4, Block 5, Block 9, and Block 12 should all be on the table separately. Block 13 should rest on Block 8, Block 2 on Block 5, Block 1 on Block 2. Your arm is currently empty and ready to make moves.
