In the Blocksworld game, you are given 13 blocks arranged in the following way: Block 10, Block 12, Block 7, Block 13, Block 3, Block 4, Block 9, and Block 6 are all on the table. Block 11 is stacked on Block 7, Block 2 is on Block 11, Block 5 is on Block 13, Block 8 is on Block 4, and finally, Block 1 is on Block 6. Important to note, your arm is currently empty. Your task is to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specific goal configuration: Block 6 should be on the table, with Block 13 stacked on it. Block 2 should also be on the table, with Block 8 on top of it, followed by Block 7 on Block 8, and Block 1 on Block 7. Separately, Block 5 should be on the table with Block 9 on top of it. Then Block 12 should be on the table with Block 3 on top, followed by Block 11 on Block 3, and Block 4 on Block 11. Finally, Block 10 should remain on the table.
