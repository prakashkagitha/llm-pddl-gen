In the Blocksworld game, you start with 15 blocks arranged in the following way: Block 15, Block 13, Block 4, Block 12, Block 11, Block 8, Block 3, Block 10, Block 5, Block 9, Block 7, Block 1, and Block 14 are all on the table. Block 6 is on top of Block 5. The rest of the blocks (Block 2) are also on the table, and your arm is free. The challenge is to reorganize the blocks to reach this target configuration: Block 6 and Block 11 stay on the table. Block 13 should be placed on top of Block 11, and Block 8 on top of Block 13. Both Block 4 and Block 3 remain on the table. Block 10 stays on the table with Block 15 on top of it. Block 5, Block 12, Block 14, Block 2, Block 7, and Block 1 all stay on the table, but Block 9 needs to be moved on top of Block 2. Good luck!
