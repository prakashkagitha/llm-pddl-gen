This particular Blocksworld problem involves 8 uniquely labeled blocks: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The initial arrangement of the blocks is as follows: Block A is on the table, Block B is stacked on Block A, Block C is on the table, Block D is on the table, Block E is stacked on Block D, Block F is on Block E, Block G is on the table, and Block H is stacked on Block G. The goal is to rearrange these blocks so that Block A is on the table, Block B is on top of Block A, Block C is on top of Block B, Block D is on the table, Block E is on Block D, Block F is on Block E, Block G is on the table, and Block H is on Block G.
