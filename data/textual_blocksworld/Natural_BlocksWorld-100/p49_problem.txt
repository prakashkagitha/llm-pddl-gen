You have a set of 15 blocks currently arranged as follows: Block 6, Block 8, Block 4, Block 11, Block 12, Block 7, and Block 9 are all placed directly on the table. Block 13 is stacked on top of Block 11. Block 15 rests on Block 14, which is on the table, and Block 10 is on top of Block 15. Continuing upward, Block 3 is on Block 10, Block 2 is on Block 3, and Block 1 is on Block 2. Additionally, Block 5 is placed directly on the table.
Your goal is to rearrange these blocks in a specific order: Start by placing Block 9 on the table. Next, put Block 15 on top of Block 9, then Block 1 on top of Block 15. Follow this by placing Block 6 on top of Block 1 and Block 7 on Block 6. Continue by stacking Block 11 on Block 7, Block 2 on Block 11, and Block 14 on Block 2. Further, place Block 3 on top of Block 14 and Block 8 on Block 3. Next, stack Block 10 on top of Block 8, Block 13 on Block 10, and Block 5 on Block 13. Finally, place Block 4 on top of Block 5 and complete the arrangement by placing Block 12 on Block 4. Your arm is currently empty, and you need to achieve this configuration.
