Imagine you are playing the Blocksworld game, and you have 14 blocks arranged in a specific way on a table. Here's how they are currently stacked: Block 3 is directly on the table, with Block 14 on top of it. Block 7 is placed on Block 14, and Block 11 sits on Block 7. Separately, Block 10 is on the table with Block 12 on top of it. Block 5 is placed on Block 12, followed by Block 6 on top of Block 5. Block 8 is stacked on Block 6, with Block 4 on Block 8. Block 9 is on top of Block 4, and Block 13 is on Block 9. Finally, Block 2 is on Block 13, and Block 1 is on top of everything. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a different configuration. In the desired setup, Block 14 should sit directly on the table, with Block 4 on it and Block 1 on top of Block 4. Additionally, Block 11 should be on the table with Block 5 on it, followed by Block 10, Block 6, and Block 12 in that order. Then, Block 3 should be on top of Block 12, with Block 7, Block 13, Block 8, Block 9, and finally Block 2 on top of each other in this specific sequence.
