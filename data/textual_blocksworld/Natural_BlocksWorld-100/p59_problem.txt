In the Blocksworld game, you currently have 12 blocks arranged as follows: Block 2 is sitting on the table. Block 3 is perched on top of Block 2. Block 12 is stacked on Block 3, and Block 4 is on Block 12. Separately, Block 6, Block 9, Block 7, Block 5, Block 11, Block 10, and Block 8 are all directly on the table. Additionally, Block 1 is on top of Block 10. At this moment, your arm is empty. The objective is to rearrange the blocks so that they are all resting individually on the table. Specifically, Block 9, Block 5, Block 8, Block 3, Block 10, Block 11, Block 6, Block 12, Block 4, Block 2, Block 7, and Block 1 should all be placed directly on the table.
