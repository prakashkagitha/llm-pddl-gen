In the Blocksworld game, you start with 13 blocks in a particular arrangement. Here is how the blocks are initially placed: Block 12 is on the table, with Block 6 on top of it, Block 1 on top of Block 6, and Block 3 on top of Block 1. Block 5 is on the table by itself. Block 8 is also on the table, with Block 10 on top of it. Block 7 stands alone on the table, supporting Block 13, which has Block 4 on top of it, Block 11 on top of Block 4, Block 2 on Block 11, and Block 9 on top of Block 2. Currently, your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 3 should be on the table, Block 8 also on the table, with Block 7 on top of it. Block 5 remains on the table, and Block 10 should be on top of Block 5. Block 1 should be placed on the table, with Block 13 on top of it, followed by Block 12 on Block 13, Block 9 on Block 12, Block 2 on Block 9, and Block 4 on Block 2. Finally, Block 11 should be on the table, with Block 6 on top of it.
