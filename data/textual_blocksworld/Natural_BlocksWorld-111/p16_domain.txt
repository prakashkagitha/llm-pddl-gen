Blocksworld is a classic problem-solving domain used in artificial intelligence research. The domain consists of a set of blocks, each uniquely identified by a letter or number. These blocks can be stacked on top of one another, forming towers of varying heights. The environment typically includes a flat surface known as the table, on which blocks can rest directly if they are not stacked on other blocks. The principal operations are picking up a block, putting it on another block, and placing it on the table. The goal is often to achieve a specific configuration of the blocks, starting from an initial random arrangement. This involves moving one block at a time, ensuring that no block is placed on a smaller one, and maintaining the integrity of the predefined goal structure. Various constraints and rules govern the Blocksworld domain, such as a block can only be moved if it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of it. The Blocksworld domain is used to study planning, problem-solving, and the development of algorithms for autonomous agents.
