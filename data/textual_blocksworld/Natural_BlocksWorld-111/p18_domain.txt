Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence, used for planning and problem-solving research. The game involves a set of blocks of various colors and sizes, and a flat surface on which these blocks can be stacked. The primary objective of the game is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration into a specified goal configuration using a sequence of legal moves. Blocks can only be moved one at a time, and a block can only be placed either on the flat surface or on top of another block. The game rules dictate that a block cannot be moved if there are other blocks on top of it. The challenge lies in figuring out the correct order of moves to achieve the goal configuration while adhering to these constraints.
