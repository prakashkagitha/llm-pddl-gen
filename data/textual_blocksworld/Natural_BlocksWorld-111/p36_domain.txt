Blocksworld is a classic planning domain used in artificial intelligence research. The scenario involves a set of blocks placed on a table, and the objective is to rearrange them to achieve a specific goal configuration. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed individually on the table. Each block can only sit on one other block or the table, and only one block can be moved at a time. The key actions in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block, putting down a block, unstacking a block from another block, and stacking a block on another block. The world state is usually represented in terms of predicates such as 'on(block1, block2)' indicating that block1 is on block2, 'clear(block)' indicating that no block is on top of a particular block, and 'handempty' indicating that the robot hand is empty. The goal is usually defined in terms of a desired configuration of the blocks involving these predicates. The simplicity and well-defined structure of Blocksworld make it an ideal domain for studying fundamental problems in planning, search algorithms, and heuristic optimization.
