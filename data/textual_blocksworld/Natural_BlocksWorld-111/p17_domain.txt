The Blocksworld domain consists of a flat table and an arbitrary number of blocks. Each block has a unique name, and blocks can be stacked on top of each other, placed on the table, or moved from one location to another. The primary actions include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another. The state of the world is defined by the positions of the blocks and whether a robot arm holds any block. The goal is typically to reach a desired configuration of blocks starting from an initial configuration. Constraints include that a block must be clear (i.e., nothing is on top of it) to be picked up or unstacked, and the robot arm can hold only one block at a time.
