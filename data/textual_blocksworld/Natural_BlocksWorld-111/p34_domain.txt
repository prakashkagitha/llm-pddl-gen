Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem used to develop and test algorithms for planning and problem-solving. The game involves a set of blocks of different colors and sizes that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The primary goal is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a specified goal configuration. Each block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it and is directly accessible. The key actions in the game include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The Blocksworld domain tests the efficiency and correctness of planning algorithms and is a common benchmark problem in the field of artificial intelligence.
