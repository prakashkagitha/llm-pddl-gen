Blocksworld is a classic domain in artificial intelligence used to exemplify task planning. It consists of a set of blocks and a table. Each block may be on the table or stacked on another block, forming vertical stacks. The primary actions that can be performed in Blocksworld include picking up a block, putting down a block, unstacking a block from another block, and stacking a block on another block. Only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it. The goals in Blocksworld typically involve arranging the blocks in a specific configuration, which requires determining an appropriate sequence of actions to transition from an initial state to the goal state. This domain challenges the planning system's ability to handle the complexity of multiple possible actions and states.
