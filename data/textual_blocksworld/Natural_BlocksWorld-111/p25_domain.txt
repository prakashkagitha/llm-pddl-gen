Blocksworld is a classic AI problem used to study planning and problem-solving. In this domain, there are several blocks of equal size and a flat, infinite surface where these blocks can be manipulated. The goal is to rearrange the blocks from a given start configuration to a desired goal configuration using a series of legal moves. The basic actions in Blocksworld include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. Each block can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it, and a block can only be placed on another block or on the flat surface. The problem is typically defined in terms of states, actions, and goals, making it an excellent testbed for algorithms in planning, search, and artificial intelligence.
