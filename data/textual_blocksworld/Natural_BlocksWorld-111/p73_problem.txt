Imagine you have 9 blocks arranged in a particular way: Block 8 is directly on the table, and Block 5 is sitting on top of Block 8. Block 1 is also on the table with Block 3 placed on it, and above Block 3 is Block 2. Block 9 is perched on top of Block 2. Another configuration sees Block 7 directly on the table, with Block 4 on top of it, and Block 6 resting on Block 4. Currently, there is nothing in your arm. The challenge is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration where Block 8 remains on the table and Block 6 is also placed on the table. Block 3 should then be on Block 6, with Block 9 on top of Block 3, continuing with Block 1 on Block 9 and Block 5 on Block 1. Block 2 should be on the table, with Block 7 above Block 2, and finally, Block 4 should be on the table.
