In the Blocksworld game, you start with 14 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Currently, Block 7, Block 11, Block 12, Block 5, Block 3, Block 14, Block 2, and Block 1 are directly on the table. Block 10 is on top of Block 12, with Block 9 stacked on Block 10. Block 13 is placed on Block 5. Block 8 is on Block 3, and Block 4 is on Block 8. Finally, Block 6 is on Block 1. Your arm is empty, meaning you are not holding any blocks at the moment. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 6, Block 12, Block 1, Block 13, Block 4, and Block 2 should be on the table. Block 3 should be placed on Block 12, Block 11 should be on Block 1, Block 10 should be on Block 2, and Block 9 should be on Block 10. Block 14 should be on Block 9, Block 7 on Block 14, Block 8 on Block 7, and finally, Block 5 should be on Block 8.
