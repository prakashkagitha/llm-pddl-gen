Blocksworld is a classic AI planning domain where a set of blocks is placed on a table, and the objective is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration. In the Blocksworld game, the blocks can be stacked on top of each other or on the table. Each block can occupy one of several possible states: on the table, on another block, or with other blocks on top of it. The game typically involves three main actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on top of another block. The picking up action involves selecting a block that is clear (i.e., no other block is on top of it) and not being held already. The putting down action involves placing a held block back onto the table. The stacking action involves placing a held block on top of another clear block. The challenge of the Blocksworld game lies in finding a sequence of actions that leads from the initial configuration of blocks to the desired goal configuration. Blocksworld is widely used in artificial intelligence research to illustrate and test various planning algorithms.
