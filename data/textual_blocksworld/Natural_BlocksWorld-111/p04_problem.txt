In the Blocksworld game, you are presented with a scenario where there are 12 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Currently, Block 9 is directly on the table, and on top of it is Block 10. Continuing this stack, Block 4 is placed on Block 10 with Block 2 on top of Block 4. Block 11 is then positioned on Block 2. Separately, Block 6 is on the table by itself. Another stack starts with Block 7 on the table, followed by Block 1 on top of Block 7. Additionally, Block 12 is on the table with Block 5 on top of it and Block 8 on top of Block 5. Lastly, Block 3 is resting directly on the table. Your arm is free to move blocks. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that each one is individually on the table with no blocks stacked on top of one another. To achieve this, place Block 6, Block 5, Block 8, Block 11, Block 12, Block 9, Block 10, Block 3, Block 7, Block 1, Block 2, and Block 4 each on the table.
