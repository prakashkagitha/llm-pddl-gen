Blocksworld is a classic AI planning domain that consists of a set of blocks placed on a table or on top of one another. The objective of the game is to move the blocks to achieve a specific configuration. In Blocksworld, each block can be in one of several states: it can be on the table, it can be on top of another block, or it can have another block on top of it. The actions available in the game typically include picking up a block, putting a block down on the table, and stacking a block on top of another block. The initial state and the goal state are defined by the specific arrangement of the blocks. The challenge is to devise a sequence of actions that transforms the initial arrangement into the goal arrangement while following the rules and constraints of the game. Each action may have preconditions that must be met before it can be executed. The simplicity of the domain makes it a popular choice for illustrating and testing various AI planning algorithms and heuristics.
