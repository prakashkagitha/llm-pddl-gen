Blocksworld is a classic AI planning problem where the goal is to manipulate a set of blocks using a robotic arm to achieve a specified configuration. The game involves a number of blocks, typically labelled A, B, C, etc., and a table with unlimited space. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Initially, the blocks are in a certain configuration, and the objective is to rearrange them into a target configuration by performing a sequence of valid moves. A valid move includes lifting a block from the table or from another block and placing it either on the table or on another block. The constraints of the game include only being able to move one block at a time and not placing a block on itself. The challenge is to come up with the shortest sequence of valid moves that transforms the initial configuration into the goal configuration.
