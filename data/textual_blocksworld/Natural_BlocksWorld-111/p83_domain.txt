Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research and robotics. The game consists of a number of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or moved between locations, such as a table. The primary operations or actions in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The objective is to reach a specific configuration of blocks from an initial configuration, following a set of rules and constraints. Only one block can be manipulated at a time, and a block can only be picked up if there are no blocks on top of it. Similarly, a block can only be stacked on top of another block if the latter is clear of any other blocks. The goal states are typically specified in terms of the desired positions or arrangements of the blocks.
