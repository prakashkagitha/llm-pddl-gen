You are playing the Blocksworld game with 13 blocks arranged in a specific way. Initially, Block 7 is resting on the table, with Block 2 stacked on top of Block 7, and Block 3 placed on Block 2. Block 12 sits directly on the table, with Block 13 on top of it. Block 6, Block 1, Block 11, Block 9, Block 4, Block 8, and Block 5 are all lying on the table as well. Additionally, Block 10 is placed on Block 4. Currently, your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that each one (Block 8, Block 6, Block 2, Block 4, Block 11, Block 12, Block 3, Block 9, Block 1, Block 10, Block 5, Block 7, and Block 13) ends up separately on the table. Good luck!
