Blocksworld is a classic planning problem in artificial intelligence where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks on a table to achieve a desired configuration. Each block is a distinct object that can exist in one of three states: on the table, stacked on another block, or with another block stacked on it. The environment includes a flat table surface which can hold any number of blocks, and a robotic arm that can pick up and move one block at a time. There are several operations that can be performed: picking up a block from the table or from another block, stacking a block on the table or on another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. The goal is to transform the initial state of the blocks into a target configuration, which may involve moving blocks to specific positions or achieving a precise order of stacking. Constraints include only being able to move one block at a time, and a block must be clear (i.e., have no other block on top of it) to be picked up. The game is used to study various aspects of planning, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI.
