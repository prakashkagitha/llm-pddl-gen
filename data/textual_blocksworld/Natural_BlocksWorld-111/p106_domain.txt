Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem that involves a set of blocks of different colors and sizes arranged on a flat surface. The goal is to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specific target configuration by a sequence of operations. The allowed operations typically include picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on top of another block.
