Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics involving a set of blocks placed on a flat surface or table. The objective is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a certain goal configuration from an initial random configuration. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed individually on the table. Each block has a unique identifier, and the table can be considered as a non-block object that can hold one block without limitation. The basic actions in Blocksworld are picking up a block from the table, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block to place it back on the table. The constraints within the game include that only one block can be moved at a time and a block cannot be picked up if there is another block on top of it. The goal configurations typically involve achieving a specific arrangement or stack order of the blocks as defined by the problem scenario.
