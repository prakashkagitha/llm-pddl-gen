Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and automated planning. It consists of a set of blocks placed on a flat surface and a robot arm that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the surface. The goal of the game is to transform an initial arrangement of blocks into a desired goal arrangement. The key actions are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Constraints include the rules that only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be picked up if it is not covered by another block, and a block can only be put down on an empty surface or on top of another block that is not being held. The problem-solving process involves determining a sequence of such actions to achieve the goal configuration from the initial configuration.
