Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem used in automated planning and robotics. It consists of a set of blocks of different colors and sizes, a table surface, and a robotic arm that can pick up and move the blocks. The objective is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration. The robotic arm can perform actions such as pick a block from the table or another block, place a block on the table or on top of another block, and hold or release a block. The challenge involves creating an efficient sequence of actions that transforms the initial state of the blocks into the desired goal state while adhering to the rules and constraints of the environment, such as only moving one block at a time and ensuring stability by not placing larger blocks on smaller blocks.
