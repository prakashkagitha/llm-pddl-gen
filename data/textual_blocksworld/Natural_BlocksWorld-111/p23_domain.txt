Blocksworld is a classic planning problem domain in artificial intelligence. The domain consists of a set of blocks and a table on which the blocks can be stacked. Each block can either be placed on the table or on another block, but only one block can be moved at any given time. Blocks can only be stacked if both the block being moved and the destination (whether it is another block or the table) are clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of them. The primary operations in Blocksworld involve picking up a block, putting a block down on the table, and stacking a block on top of another block. The objective is to transform the initial configuration of blocks into a desired goal configuration through a sequence of valid moves. Blocksworld provides a simple yet effective environment for studying the principles of planning, manipulation tasks, and the execution of sequences of actions.
