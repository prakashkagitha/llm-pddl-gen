In the Blocksworld game, you start with 12 blocks arranged as follows: Block 9 sits on the table with Block 2 on top of it, followed by Block 1 on top of Block 2, and Block 6 on top of Block 1. Separately, Block 7 rests on the table with Block 5 stacked on it. Block 10 is also on the table, with Block 4 on top of it, Block 3 on top of Block 4, and Block 12 on top of Block 3, followed by Block 8, and finally Block 11 at the top. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so they are in a new configuration: Block 9, Block 12, Block 10, Block 5, Block 6, Block 7, Block 2, Block 3, Block 4, and Block 8 should all be on the table. Meanwhile, Block 11 should be placed on Block 5, and Block 1 should be placed on Block 4. Start with an empty arm and achieve this new arrangement of blocks.
