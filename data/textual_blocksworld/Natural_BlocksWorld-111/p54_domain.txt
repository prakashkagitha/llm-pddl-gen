Blocksworld is a puzzle game played in a simple environment involving a set of blocks of various colors usually placed upon a flat surface. The primary objective is to move and stack the blocks to achieve a specific goal configuration from an initial arrangement. The game is popular in artificial intelligence research and often used to test planning algorithms. There are a few key actions that can be performed: moving a block from the table onto another block, moving a block from another block back onto the table, and moving a block from one block to another block. The constraints typically include that only one block can be moved at a time and that no block can be moved unless it is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. The rules encourage sequential problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and strategic planning.
