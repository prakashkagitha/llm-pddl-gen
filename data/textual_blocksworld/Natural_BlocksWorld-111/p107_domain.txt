The domain of Blocksworld consists of a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table. The goal is to reach a specific configuration starting from a given initial configuration. The actions available are 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', 'stack a block on another', and 'unstack a block from another'. Each move must adhere to the rules: only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it does not have another block on top of it.
