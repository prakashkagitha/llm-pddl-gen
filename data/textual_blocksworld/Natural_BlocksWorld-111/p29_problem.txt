You have a set of 9 blocks arranged on a table. Initially, all blocks, numbered 1 to 9, are placed separately on the table. Your task is to rearrange these blocks into a specific order. In the desired configuration, Block 9 should remain on the table with Block 3 placed on top of it, followed by Block 2 on Block 3, and then Block 4 on top of Block 2. Additionally, Block 5 should stay on the table with Block 1 on top of it, followed by Block 6 on Block 1. Finally, Block 8 should remain on the table with Block 7 placed on top of it. You start with an empty arm and need to achieve this arrangement.
