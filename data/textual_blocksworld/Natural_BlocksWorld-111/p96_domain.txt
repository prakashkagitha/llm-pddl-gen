Blocksworld is a classic problem-solving game where the goal is to rearrange a set of blocks into a specific configuration. In the game, blocks are usually placed on a table, and the player can perform actions to move a block from one location to another. Each block can either be on the table, on top of another block, or have another block on top of it. The primary actions include picking up a block, putting a block down, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. There are constraints in the game, such as only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if it is clear (no other block on top of it), and a block can only be placed on a clear surface. The objective is to achieve a desired end configuration starting from an initial configuration through a sequence of valid actions while adhering to the rules. The game is often used for research in artificial intelligence and robotics to study planning and reasoning.
