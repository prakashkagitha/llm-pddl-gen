Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain consisting of a set of blocks and a table. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The primary actions in the domain are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Each block can only support one block on top of it, and a block can only be moved if it has no blocks on top of it. The objective in the Blocksworld domain is typically to achieve a certain configuration of blocks, given an initial configuration. Agents in this domain must operate under constraints such as the limited number of blocks they can manipulate at one time and the physical rules governing the stacking of blocks. The simplicity and constraints of the Blocksworld domain make it a useful testbed for the development and evaluation of planning algorithms in AI.
