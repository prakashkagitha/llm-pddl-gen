Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence. The game consists of a set of blocks and a table. Each block can either be on the table, on another block, or have another block on top of it. The goal is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks from a given starting configuration. Movements are constrained by the rules that a block can only be moved if it has no other block on top of it and it can only be placed either on the table or on another block with no block already on top. The objective is typically to use a sequence of valid moves to transform the initial configuration of blocks into the goal configuration, demonstrating an optimal solution or a feasible sequence of actions.
