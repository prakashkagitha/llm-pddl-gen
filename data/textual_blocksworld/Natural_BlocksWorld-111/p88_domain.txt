Blocksworld is a classic AI planning problem where the objective is to move a set of blocks from an initial configuration to a specified goal configuration. The game includes a finite set of blocks, typically labeled A, B, C, and so on. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table surface. The table has unlimited space and can hold any number of blocks. The primary actions in the Blocksworld domain are 'pick up', 'put down', 'stack', and 'unstack'. The 'pick up' action allows an agent to lift a block from the table. The 'put down' action allows an agent to place a block onto the table. The 'stack' action allows an agent to place one block on top of another block. The 'unstack' action allows an agent to remove a block from on top of another block. The goal is to transform the initial arrangement of blocks into a target configuration by performing a sequence of valid actions. Each action has preconditions that must be met for the action to be executed, such as requiring a block to be clear (no other block on top of it) before it can be picked up or stacked on. The challenge lies in efficiently finding the sequence of actions that achieves the goal configuration using minimal moves.
