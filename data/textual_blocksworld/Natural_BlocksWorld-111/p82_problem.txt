You are playing the Blocksworld game with 10 blocks. Initially, the blocks are arranged as follows: Block 3 is placed directly on the table, with Block 7 stacked on top of it. Block 10 is also on the table, as are Blocks 4, 2, 9, 1, 6, and 5. Additionally, Block 8 is currently on top of Block 5. Your arm is free to move blocks around. Your objective is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 6, Block 2, and Block 10 remain directly on the table. On top of Block 2, you should place Block 7, followed by Block 4. Place Block 8 on top of Block 10, then put Block 1 on Block 8, and Block 3 on Block 1. Finally, Block 9 should be placed on Block 3, and Block 5 should be placed on Block 9. Can you achieve this final configuration?
