Blocksworld is a classic problem-solving domain used in artificial intelligence research. The game involves a collection of blocks placed on a table, with the goal of rearranging them in a specified configuration using a series of actions. The blocks can vary in size, shape, and color, but they are typically treated as uniform entities for simplicity. The primary actions available in the Blocksworld domain are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from another block. A block can be picked up only if it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it, and it can be put down only if the position where it is to be placed is clear. The game is usually governed by a simple set of rules that ensure only valid moves are made. The primary challenge in the Blocksworld domain is to find the sequence of actions that transforms the initial configuration of blocks into the goal configuration. This requires planning and problem-solving skills, making it an interesting and widely-studied domain in the field of artificial intelligence.
