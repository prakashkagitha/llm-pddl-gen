The problem involves 9 blocks labeled A through I. The initial configuration has the blocks on the table in the following arrangement: Block A, Block B, and Block C are stacked on each other in that order with Block A at the bottom, Block D and Block E are placed individually on the table, Block F is on Block G, while Blocks H and I are on the table. The goal is to reorganize the blocks to achieve the following configuration: All blocks stacked in alphabetical order (A at the bottom to I at the top) in a single tower on the table. This requires a sequence of actions to pick up and rearrange the blocks from their initial scattered state to the final stacked state.
