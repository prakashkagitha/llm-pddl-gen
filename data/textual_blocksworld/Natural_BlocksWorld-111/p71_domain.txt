Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics that involves a set of blocks of various shapes and sizes, which need to be stacked on top of one another. The objective is to move the blocks from an initial random configuration to a specific goal configuration using a series of legal moves. Each block is either on the table or on another block. The primary actions available in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The goal state is typically defined as a particular arrangement of blocks, and the challenge is to reach this arrangement with a sequence of actions that obey the rules of the domain. The game requires careful planning and the solution often involves techniques from the field of automated planning and scheduling.
