The domain of the Blocksworld game consists of a table surface and a set of blocks labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The objective is to move the blocks to achieve a specific goal configuration. The actions allowed in the domain are stacking one block on top of another block or placing a block on the table. Additionally, only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it (i.e., the block is clear). The initial and goal configurations define the problem instance.
