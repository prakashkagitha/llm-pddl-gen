The Blocksworld domain consists of a table and a set of blocks of various shapes and colors that can be stacked on one another. The objective is to manipulate the blocks using a robotic arm so that they meet a specified end goal configuration. Actions include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another. The game follows the constraints that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block cannot be moved if there is another block on top of it.
