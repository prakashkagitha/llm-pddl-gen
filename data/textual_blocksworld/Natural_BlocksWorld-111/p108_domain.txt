The Blocksworld domain involves a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a flat surface. The primary goal is to rearrange the blocks from a given initial configuration to a desired goal configuration. Each block is uniquely identified and can either be placed directly on the table or on top of another block. There is only one crane that can move one block at a time. The actions allowed are picking up a block, putting a block on another block, and putting a block on the table. The key constraints are that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
