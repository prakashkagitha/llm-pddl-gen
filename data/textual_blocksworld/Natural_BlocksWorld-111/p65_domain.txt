Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics. The game involves a set of blocks of equal size that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a table. Each block can either be clear (nothing on top of it) or covered (another block on top of it). The goal is to move blocks to achieve a specific configuration from a given initial setup. The rules are simple: only one block can be moved at a time, and it can only be moved if it is clear. The objective is to develop an efficient sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration of blocks into the target configuration. The domain involves elements like blocks, tables, and hands (to simulate picking up and putting down blocks). Actions in this domain typically include picking up a block, putting down a block on another block or on the table, and checking if a block is clear.
