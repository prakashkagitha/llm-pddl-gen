In this particular instance of the Blocksworld game, we have six blocks labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Initially, block A is on the table, block B is stacked on top of block C, block C is on the table, block D is on the table, block E is stacked on top of block D, and block F is on the table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, which is on top of block C, which is on the table; block D is on the table; and block E is on top of block F, which is on the table.
