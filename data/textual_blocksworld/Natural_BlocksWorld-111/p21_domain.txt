Blocksworld is a classic planning problem domain in artificial intelligence and robotics. It consists of several blocks placed on a flat surface called the table. The user can manipulate the blocks using a robotic arm to achieve a desired goal configuration. Each block can either be on the table or placed on top of another block. The domain assumes that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it. Common goals involve stacking blocks in a particular order or achieving certain arrangements. The primary actions available are 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', and 'stack a block on another block'. The Blocksworld domain is used extensively to study problem-solving, planning, and the efficiency of different algorithms in achieving the desired configurations.
