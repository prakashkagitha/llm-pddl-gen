Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain, often used as a benchmark in the field of automated planning and robotics. The domain consists of a set of uniquely named blocks, typically identified by labels such as A, B, C, etc., and a flat surface on which these blocks can be stacked. The goal in Blocksworld is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a specified goal configuration using a basic set of actions. The primary actions within the domain include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking one block from another. Each action has preconditions that must be satisfied in order to be executed. For example, to pick up a block, the block must be clear (i.e., there is no other block on top of it) and the robot's hand must be empty. Similarly, to stack a block onto another block, both blocks must be clear and the block to be moved must be held by the robot. The constraints and simplicity of the Blocksworld domain make it an ideal testbed for studying fundamental concepts in planning algorithms, such as state representation, goal recognition, and solution optimization.
