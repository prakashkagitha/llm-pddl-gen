Blocksworld is a problem-solving domain used in artificial intelligence research involving a collection of blocks placed on a table. The goal is to stack and unstack blocks to achieve a specific configuration from an initial arrangement. The world consists of several blocks, each of which can be stacked on top of another block or placed on the table. The blocks can only be moved one at a time, and a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it. The objective is typically to achieve a specified goal position using a series of actions while respecting the constraints of the environment. The primary actions available are 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', 'stack a block on another block', and 'unstack a block from another block'. Blocksworld problems can vary in complexity depending on the number of blocks and the intricacy of the target configuration.
