The Blocksworld game consists of a set of colored blocks and a flat surface where these blocks can be stacked one on top of another. There are a few basic actions that can be performed within the game. A block can be picked up from the table or from the top of another block. It can then be placed either back on the table or on top of another block. Each block can be in one of three states: on the table, on another block, or being held. The goal of the game is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a target configuration by using the allowed actions. The actions must follow the game's rules: only one block can be moved at a time, and no block can be moved if it is not clear (i.e., if it has another block on top of it). The domain thus involves objects (blocks), states (positions on the table, on other blocks, or being held), and actions (pick up, put down, stack on another block). Additionally, each state transition must adhere to the rules, ensuring only valid states can be generated during the game's progression.
