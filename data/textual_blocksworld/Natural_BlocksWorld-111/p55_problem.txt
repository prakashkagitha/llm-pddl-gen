In the Blocksworld game, you start with seven blocks arranged in a specific manner. Currently, Block 5 is placed on the table, with Block 3 sitting on top of it. Block 7 is also on the table, as well as Block 1 and Block 2. However, Block 4 is positioned on top of Block 2, and Block 6 rests on the table alongside the others. You begin with an empty arm, and your task is to rearrange the blocks so that each one ends up on the table by itself. The final goal is to have Blocks 3, 2, 7, 6, 1, 4, and 5 all resting separately on the table.
