Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics. It consists of a set of blocks of various sizes and colors, which are placed on a flat surface. The objective is to manipulate the blocks using a robotic arm to achieve a specific goal configuration. Each block can be picked up, placed on top of another block, or put down on the surface. The actions allowed are picking up a block that is clear (no other block on top of it), stacking a block on another one that is clear, or unstacking a block from a stack. The initial state of the blocks and the goal state are provided, and the task is to find a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time and that blocks can be stacked or unstacked only if the robotic arm is not holding another block. The Blocksworld domain tests the planning and problem-solving capabilities of AI algorithms.
