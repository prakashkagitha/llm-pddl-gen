The Blocksworld domain involves a set of blocks, typically labeled with letters or numbers, and a flat surface on which these blocks can be placed. The primary goal is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a desired final configuration. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the flat surface, but each block can only be moved from the top of a stack. The actions available in the Blocksworld domain typically include picking up a block, stacking a block on another block, and placing a block on the flat surface. The game emphasizes problem-solving and planning as players must determine the sequence of moves needed to achieve the goal configuration while adhering to the constraints of only moving blocks that are not covered by others.
