Blocksworld is a classic planning problem in the field of artificial intelligence. The game consists of a set of blocks placed on a table. Each block can either be on the table or stacked on another block, and can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it. The aim of the game is to move the blocks to achieve a desired goal configuration from a given initial configuration. Actions include picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on top of another block. Constraints include ensuring that a block can only be moved if it is clear (i.e., no blocks are on top of it) and a block can only be placed on the table or on a clear block. The challenges in Blocksworld include planning the sequence of moves to reach the goal configuration and ensuring that intermediate states do not prevent the possibility of reaching the goal.
