Blocksworld is a classic planning problem that involves manipulating a set of blocks stacked on a table. The goal is to move blocks to achieve a specified configuration from an initial configuration. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed directly on the table. The table surface and all individual blocks are distinguishable entities in the game. Each block has a unique identifier, and there is an unlimited amount of space on the table to place blocks. Blocks can only be moved one at a time and must be cleared of any blocks on top before being moved. The key actions in the Blocksworld domain include: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Constraints include ensuring a block is clear before it is picked up or stacked and that a block is not being held before picking up another block. The game is commonly used to model and study the challenges of automated planning and scheduling in artificial intelligence.
