Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research. The game consists of a set of blocks of various sizes that are placed on a table. The objective is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a target configuration using a robotic arm. Each block can either be placed on the table or stacked on top of another block. The main rules of the game are: only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if it does not have another block on top of it, and the robotic arm can only hold one block at a time. The challenge lies in making sequential moves that transform the initial configuration of the blocks into the desired configuration while adhering to these constraints.
