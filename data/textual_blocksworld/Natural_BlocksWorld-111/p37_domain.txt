Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence. The game consists of a set of blocks placed on a table, where each block can be stacked on top of another block or move independently. The primary goal is to transform the initial configuration of blocks into a specific goal configuration, adhering to a set of predefined rules. A block can be moved if and only if it has no other blocks on top of it (i.e., it is clear). Actions in the Blocksworld domain typically include picking up a clear block, putting down a held block onto the table, and stacking a held block onto another clear block. Each action must ensure that blocks remain stable and balanced in their final positions. The planning task involves generating a sequence of valid moves that transitions the blocks from the initial state to the goal state while minimizing the number of moves or time needed.
