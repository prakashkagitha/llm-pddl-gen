In the Blocksworld game, you have 10 blocks arranged in a specific configuration on the table. Currently, Block 10, Block 4, Block 3, Block 2, Block 9, Block 7, Block 8, Block 6, Block 5, and Block 1 are all placed directly on the table. Your arm is empty and ready to move blocks. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in a new configuration with Block 8, Block 5, Block 3, Block 10, Block 9, Block 2, Block 6, Block 7, Block 4, and Block 1 all placed directly on the table in that specific order.
