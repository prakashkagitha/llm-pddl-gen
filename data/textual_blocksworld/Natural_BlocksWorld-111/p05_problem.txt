In the Blocksworld game, you start with 14 blocks arranged as follows: Block 8 is on the table, with Block 3 stacked on top of it. Block 12 is also on the table, and Block 2 is on top of it. Similarly, Block 5 is on the table with Block 10 on top, and Block 6 on top of Block 10. Block 14 is on the table, with Block 4 on top of it. Block 11 sits on the table, with Block 9 on top, and Block 1 on top of Block 9. Block 13 and Block 7 are both directly on the table. Your arm is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks to achieve this final configuration: Block 7 on the table with Block 5 on top, followed by Block 8 on Block 5, Block 9 on Block 8, Block 3 on Block 9, Block 12 on Block 3, and Block 14 on Block 12. Additionally, Block 10 should be on the table, with Block 6 on top, followed by Block 13 on Block 6 and Block 11 on Block 13. Finally, Block 4 should be on the table with Block 2 on top, and Block 1 on Block 2.
