The Blocksworld domain consists of a puzzle where the player is given a set of blocks and a table. Each block can be stacked on top of another block or placed directly on the table. The goal is to reach a specified configuration by moving one block at a time with the following rules: 1) Only one block can be moved at a time, 2) A block can only be moved if it is clear (i.e., there is no other block on top of it), 3) A block can be placed either on the table or on another block as long as the placement does not violate the previous rules.
