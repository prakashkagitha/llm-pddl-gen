The Blocksworld domain involves a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table. The objective is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks using a series of actions such as picking up a block, putting it down on the table, or stacking it on another block. The actions must adhere to the constraints that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be picked up if it is clear (i.e., it has no other blocks on top of it). The domain fundamentally revolves around understanding relationships like 'on', 'clear', and the action preconditions and effects.
