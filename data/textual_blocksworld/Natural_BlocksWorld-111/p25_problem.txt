In the Blocksworld game, you start with 14 blocks arranged as follows: Block 4 is on the table. Block 13 is also on the table with Block 6 stacked on top of it. Block 1 is placed on Block 6, and Block 7 is on Block 1. Meanwhile, Block 8 and Block 14 are on the table. On top of Block 14, there is Block 5 with Block 3 on Block 5, and Block 11 sits on Block 3. Stacked above that, Block 9 is on Block 11, Block 10 is on Block 9, and Block 12 is on Block 10. Block 2 is also on the table. Currently, your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that each block is directly on the table. This includes Blocks 10, 5, 11, 4, 1, 2, 9, 8, 7, 14, 13, 12, 3, and 6, all placed separately on the table.
