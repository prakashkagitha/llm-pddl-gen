In the Blocksworld game, you start with 12 blocks arranged in a simple setup where each block is independently resting on the table. Specifically, blocks numbered 1 through 12 are all placed directly on the table. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a specific stacked configuration. Hereâ€™s what the final arrangement should look like: Block 6 is positioned on the table with Block 9 placed on top of it. Next, Block 2 should be on the table, with Block 3 on top of Block 2. Block 7 will sit on Block 3, and Block 4 will be on Block 7. Furthermore, Block 11 needs to be placed on Block 4, with Block 12 on top of Block 11. Then, Block 8 should be placed on Block 12, followed by Block 1, which should be on Block 8. Block 10 is to be placed on Block 1, and finally, Block 5 should be on top of Block 10. You start with an empty arm, ready to move the blocks into their designated positions.
