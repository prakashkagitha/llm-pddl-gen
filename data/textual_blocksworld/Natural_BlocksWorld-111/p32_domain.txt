The Blocksworld game is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, centered around a table, a set of blocks, and a robotic arm. The blocks come in various shapes and sizes, and they can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table. The main objective is to transform a given initial arrangement of the blocks into a specified goal arrangement. The robotic arm can perform basic operations such as picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking one block atop another. The game is governed by a few simple rules: only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it, and the table is large enough to hold all the blocks side by side. The complexity and challenge of Blocksworld arise from the number of blocks and the specificity of the goal arrangements.
