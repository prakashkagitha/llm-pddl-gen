Blocksworld is a classic planning problem in the field of artificial intelligence. The game consists of a set of blocks and a table. The blocks can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table. The objective is to achieve a specified arrangement of the blocks starting from a given initial configuration. Each block can be stacked or unstacked only one block at a time, and only if the block being moved is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it. Similarly, blocks can only be placed on either the table or another clear block. The game emphasizes strategic planning and problem-solving as players or AI agents determine the sequence of actions required to transform the initial state to the goal state.
