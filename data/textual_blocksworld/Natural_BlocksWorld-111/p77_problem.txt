In the Blocksworld game, you start with 15 blocks arranged as follows: Blocks 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 5, 7, 3, 15, and 4 are all on the table. Block 10 is on top of Block 5. Block 9 is on the table. Your arm is empty. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a specific configuration: Block 10 should be on the table, with Block 6 on top of it, and Block 4 on top of Block 6. Continue stacking blocks in the following order: Block 9 on Block 4, Block 1 on Block 9, Block 13 on Block 1, Block 8 on Block 13, Block 11 on Block 8, Block 3 on Block 11, Block 14 on Block 3, Block 7 on Block 14, Block 2 on Block 7, Block 15 on Block 2, Block 12 on Block 15, and finally Block 5 on Block 12.
