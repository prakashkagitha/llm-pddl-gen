Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks arranged in stacks on a table. The game consists of a finite set of actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The key constraints are that a block can only be moved if it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it, and there is only one robotic arm available to carry out these actions. The goal is to achieve a specific arrangement of blocks from a given initial configuration, typically described in terms of which blocks are on top of which other blocks. The challenge involves determining a sequence of actions that transforms the initial configuration to the goal configuration while adhering to the constraints.
