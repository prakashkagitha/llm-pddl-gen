Blocksworld is a classic planning domain in artificial intelligence used to study automated planning and robotics. It consists of a set of blocks of various sizes, shapes, or colors, and a table surface where these blocks can be placed and moved. There are two main actions in Blocksworld: picking up a block and placing it either on top of another block or on the table. The objective is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to match a goal configuration using a sequence of valid moves. Constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be picked up if it has no other blocks on top of it. The challenge lies in finding an optimal or feasible sequence of actions to achieve the desired arrangement.
