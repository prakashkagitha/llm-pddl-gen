Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem. It consists of a set of blocks placed on a flat surface, and a robotic arm that can pick up and move these blocks. The blocks are usually distinguished by labels or colors, and the surface they rest on is typically referred to as the table. The goal is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a desired configuration by performing a sequence of moves. The moves include stacking a block on another block, unstacking a block from another block, picking up a block from the table, and putting a block down on the table. The domain highlights challenges such as ensuring blocks are only moved when the arm is free, and maintaining stability by not allowing blocks to float in mid-air. Solving Blocksworld requires careful planning and consideration of the constraints and sequential dependencies inherent to the task.
