Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and operations research. The environment consists of a set of distinct blocks that are initially arranged in a predefined configuration on a flat surface called the table. Each block can be stacked on top of another or placed directly on the table. The goal is to achieve a specific target configuration starting from the initial setup. Operations allowed in the Blocksworld include picking up a block from the table or from another block, placing a block onto the table, or stacking a block onto another block. No more than one block may be moved at a time, and only the top block of any stack can be manipulated. The game poses challenges in sequential decision-making and is often used to test the efficiency of sorting algorithms and planning techniques.
