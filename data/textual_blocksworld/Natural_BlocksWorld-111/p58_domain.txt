The Blocksworld game is a classic AI planning problem involving a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a table. The domain consists of the following components: blocks, actions, and goals. Each block can either be on the table or on another block, cannot be moved if another block is on top of it, and can only be picked if it is clear. The primary actions available are picking up a block, putting a block down on the table, stacking a block onto another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Goals in the Blocksworld game typically involve arranging the blocks into a specific configuration defined by the user. Solving a Blocksworld problem involves finding a sequence of actions that transforms the initial configuration of blocks into the desired goal configuration without violating the constraints of the domain.
