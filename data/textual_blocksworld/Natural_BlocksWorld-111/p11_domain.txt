Blocksworld is a classic Artificial Intelligence problem used to illustrate planning and reasoning. The game takes place on a table and involves manipulating a set of distinct, stackable blocks. The blocks can be arranged in various configurations, starting with an initial state and aiming to achieve a predetermined goal state. The player or agent can perform actions such as picking up a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. The constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be picked up if there are no other blocks on top of it. The challenge is to sequence these actions to transform the initial state of the blocks into the goal state, following the rules and constraints given.
