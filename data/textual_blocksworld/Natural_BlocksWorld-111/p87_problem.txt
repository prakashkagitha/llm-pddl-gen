In the Blocksworld game, you start with 13 blocks arranged in a particular order. Here's the current setup: Block 10 is sitting directly on the table. Block 6 is placed on top of Block 10, and following this sequence, Block 4 is on Block 6, Block 13 is on Block 4, Block 3 is on Block 13, Block 2 is on Block 3, Block 5 is on Block 2, Block 1 is on Block 5, Block 12 is on Block 1, Block 9 is on Block 12, Block 7 is on Block 9, Block 8 is on Block 7, and finally, Block 11 is on Block 8. Your hand is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration: Place Block 11 on the table. Block 6 should also be on the table, with Block 8 positioned on top of Block 6. Block 3 should be placed on the table with Block 10 on top of it. Put Block 7 on the table and Block 9 on top of it. Set Block 12 on the table alongside Block 5, Block 2, Block 4, and Block 1, all sitting directly on the table. Finally, place Block 13 on top of Block 4.
