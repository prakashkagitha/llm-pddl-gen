In the Blocksworld game, we have a starting arrangement with 14 blocks. The initial configuration is as follows: Block 13, Block 5, Block 11, Block 8, Block 2, Block 7, Block 6, Block 12, Block 3, Block 9, Block 4, Block 1, and Block 10 are all on the table. Block 14 is placed on top of Block 8. Your arm is empty at the beginning. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 4, Block 6, Block 14, Block 8, Block 9, Block 3, Block 12, Block 11, Block 2, Block 5, and Block 1 should be placed on the table. Block 10 needs to be on top of Block 9. Block 7 should be on Block 2, and Block 13 should be on top of Block 7.
