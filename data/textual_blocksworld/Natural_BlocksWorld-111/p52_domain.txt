The Blocksworld domain consists of a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a table. The main objective is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks by moving them according to certain rules. The primary actions available are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. Each block can either be on the table or on top of another block, but not both at the same time. There are typically constraints such as only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be picked up if there are no other blocks on top of it. The initial state describes the starting configuration of the blocks, and the goal state describes the desired configuration. The challenge is to determine the sequence of actions needed to reach the goal state from the initial state while adhering to the rules of the game.
