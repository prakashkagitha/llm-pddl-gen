Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem domain used for testing and developing planning and reasoning algorithms. The game consists of a collection of blocks of varying colors, shapes, or sizes that can be placed on top of each other or on a table. Blocks can only be moved one at a time using a robotic arm that can pick up the topmost block from a stack and place it on another stack or on the table. The goal is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks starting from an initial arrangement. The main actions in Blocksworld include picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on top of another block. The game is often used to illustrate concepts in automated planning, search algorithms, and machine learning.
