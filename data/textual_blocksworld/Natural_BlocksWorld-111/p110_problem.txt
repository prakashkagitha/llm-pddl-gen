The Blocksworld problem involves 14 blocks labeled A through N. The initial configuration has blocks in the following setup: Block A is on the table, Block B is on top of Block A, Block C is on the table, Block D is on top of Block C, Block E is on the table, Block F is on top of Block E, Block G is on the table, Block H is on top of Block G, Block I is on the table, Block J is on top of Block I, Block K is on the table, Block L is on top of Block K, Block M is on the table, and Block N is on top of Block M. The goal configuration is to have all the blocks stacked in the following order starting from the table upwards: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N.
