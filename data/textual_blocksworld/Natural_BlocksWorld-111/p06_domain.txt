Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration using a robotic arm. The game is played on a table, and the blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed directly on the table. The blocks are distinguishable from each other, often labeled with distinct letters or colors. The rules for manipulation include picking up a block if it is clear (no other block on top of it), placing a block on the table, or stacking it on another block as long as the destination block is clear. The game state is defined by the position and order of the blocks, and actions are executed to transition from one state to another, aiming to reach a predefined goal state. The complexity of the domain arises from the constraints on movement and the need to carefully sequence actions to avoid deadlock situations, ensuring that intermediate states do not obstruct achieving the goal. The Blocksworld domain is used extensively to test and demonstrate planning algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence.
