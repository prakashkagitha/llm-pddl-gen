Blocksworld is a classic AI planning problem where the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot arm. The objective is to move the blocks to reach a desired configuration from an initial state, using a predefined set of actions. The domain is characterized by the following elements: Blocks, which can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table; a table, which serves as the base where blocks can be placed directly; and a robot arm, which can pick up and move a single block at a time. The possible actions in Blocksworld include 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', 'stack a block on another block', and 'unstack a block from another block'. Constraints include that the robot arm can hold only one block at a time, and a block can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it. The goal is to transform the initial arrangement of blocks into a specified goal configuration, often with the consideration of minimizing the number of moves.
