Blocksworld is a classic AI planning domain involving a set of blocks and a flat surface or a table. The main goal in Blocksworld is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a target configuration using a set of permissible actions. Each block can be either on the table or on top of another block, and only one block can be moved at a time. The permissible actions typically include 'pick up a block', 'put down a block on the table', and 'stack a block on another block'. The constraints usually prevent actions that would place a block on top of a smaller block or move non-existing blocks. Blocksworld serves as a common testbed for testing algorithms in automated planning, AI, robotics, and cognitive science.
