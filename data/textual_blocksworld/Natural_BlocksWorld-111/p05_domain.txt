Blocksworld is a classical domain used in artificial intelligence for planning and problem-solving scenarios. The environment consists of a table, a set of blocks of different sizes, shapes, or colors, and a robotic arm or agent that can manipulate the blocks. Each block can either be on the table or stacked on another block, and the objective is to reach a specified configuration of the blocks starting from an initial configuration. The key actions typically include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another. The game is often used to test algorithms' abilities to find sequences of actions that transform the initial state into the goal state, dealing with challenges such as arranging blocks without causing the stack to become unstable or empty-handed constraints for the robotic arm. Blocksworld scenarios can vary in complexity, ranging from simple tasks to highly complex ones that require intricate planning and optimization.
