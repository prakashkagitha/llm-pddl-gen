Blocksworld is a classic AI planning problem environment. It consists of a table, a set of distinguishable blocks, and possibly a robotic arm or manipulator that can move the blocks. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The objective is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a desired goal configuration using a series of operations. The primary operations available are: picking up a block from the table, putting down a block onto the table, stacking a block onto another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Each operation is constrained by preconditions that must be satisfied for the action to be performed, such as a block being clear (nothing on top of it) before it can be picked up or unstacked. The blocks can only be moved one at a time and cannot be partially moved. The game models concepts such as planning, state space search, and problem-solving in AI.
