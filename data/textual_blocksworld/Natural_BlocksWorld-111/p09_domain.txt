Blocksworld is a classic planning domain in artificial intelligence where an agent manipulates a set of blocks arranged in stacks on a table. The goal is to transition from an initial configuration of blocks to a desired goal configuration. The domain includes a flat table and a finite number of uniquely identifiable blocks. Each block can be either on the table, on top of another block, or clear (having no blocks on top of it). Basic actions in this domain include picking up a block from the table, putting a block down on the table, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from on top of another block. The challenge is to find a sequence of these actions that transforms the initial state to the goal state, often measured in terms of efficiency and optimality of the solution path. The Blocksworld domain is fundamental for studying problem-solving and planning algorithms.
