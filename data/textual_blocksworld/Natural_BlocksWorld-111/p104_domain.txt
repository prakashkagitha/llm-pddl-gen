The Blocksworld domain consists of a set of blocks, a table surface, and a robot hand that can grasp and move the blocks. In this domain, blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The robot hand can execute a series of actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on another block. The primary goal is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks starting from a given initial configuration using the above actions.
