In the Blocksworld game, we start with 13 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. On the table, we have Block 1. Block 5 is placed on top of Block 1, followed by Block 9 on Block 5, and then Block 3 on Block 9. Continuing upwards, Block 2 is on Block 3, Block 8 is on Block 2, Block 6 is on Block 8, Block 11 is on Block 6, and finally, Block 4 is on Block 11. This forms a tall stack of blocks. Separately, Block 12 is on the table with Block 13 on top of it, and Block 10 placed on Block 13. Lastly, Block 7 is on top of Block 10. Your arm is currently free, and the objective is to reconfigure the blocks into their goal positions. In the desired arrangement, Block 3 should be on the table with Block 2 on top of it. Block 11 should be on the table with Block 6 on top of it, followed by Block 9 on Block 6. Block 8, Block 13, Block 5, and Block 7 should each be placed directly on the table. On top of Block 5, Block 4 should be placed, followed by Block 1 on Block 4. Finally, Block 12 should be on Block 7, and Block 10 should be directly on the table.
