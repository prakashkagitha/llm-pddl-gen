You start with 13 blocks arranged in a specific order. Block 11 is directly on the table, and on top of Block 11, there is Block 4. Continuing upwards, Block 3 is on Block 4, Block 6 is on Block 3, Block 1 is on Block 6, Block 12 is on Block 1, Block 10 is on Block 12, Block 9 is on Block 10, Block 13 is on Block 9, Block 2 is on Block 13, Block 8 is on Block 2, Block 5 is on Block 8, and finally Block 7 is on Block 5. Currently, your arm is free and not holding any blocks. Your objective is to rearrange the blocks into a new order. In the desired configuration, Block 9 should be directly on the table, as well as Block 1 and Block 13. Block 10 should sit on Block 13, and Block 12 should be on its own on the table. Block 8 needs to be placed on Block 12. Meanwhile, Block 3 should be on the table with Block 2 on top of it, and Block 11 should rest on Block 2. Finally, Block 7, Block 5, and Block 4 should each be on the table, with Block 6 placed on Block 4.
