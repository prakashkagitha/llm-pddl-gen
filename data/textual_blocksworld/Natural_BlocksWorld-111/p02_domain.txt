Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem that involves manipulating a set of blocks placed on a table. The key components of the Blocksworld domain are blocks, a table, and a robot arm. Each block has a unique identifier and can be stacked on top of another block or placed directly on the table. The table represents a flat surface on which blocks can initially be placed or moved to from any position. The robot arm can pick up and move one block at a time from one position to another. The primary objective in Blocksworld is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a specified goal configuration through a series of valid moves. Constraints in the Blocksworld domain include only being able to move the top block from any stack and having only one block held by the robot arm at a time. The main actions available are 'pick up a block from the table,' 'put a block down on the table,' 'stack a block on another block,' and 'unstack a block from a stack.' The domain is characterized by its simplicity and the clear representation of state transitions, making it a popular choice for studying various planning algorithms and techniques in artificial intelligence.
