You are presented with a puzzle involving 14 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Currently, Block 4 sits on the table with Block 3 stacked on top of it. Block 12 is also on the table, as are Blocks 5, 7, 1, 8, 10, 11, and 6. On Block 7, Block 2 rests securely. Block 9 is set atop Block 10, and Block 13 is positioned on Block 6 with Block 14 on top of it. Your objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve a new configuration: Start with Block 7 on the table, place Block 2 on top of Block 7, followed by Block 11 on Block 2. Continue by placing Block 1 on Block 11 and Block 3 on Block 1. Then, position Block 6 on the table, and stack Block 5 on Block 6, followed by Block 10 on Block 5. Next, place Block 13 on Block 10, and then stack Block 12 on Block 13 with Block 14 on top. Continue by placing Block 9 on Block 14, Block 8 on Block 9, and finally Block 4 on Block 8.
