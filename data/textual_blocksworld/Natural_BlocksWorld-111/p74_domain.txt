The Blocksworld game is a classic planning domain where the objective is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks through a series of moves. The game consists of a set of distinct, individual blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Each block can either be on top of another block or directly on the table. Actions in the game include 'pick up a block,' 'put down a block,' 'stack a block on another block,' and 'unstack a block from another block.' Only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be picked up if it has no other blocks on top of it. Similarly, a block can only be placed on another block if the destination block is clear, meaning it has no blocks on top of it. The goal of the Blocksworld game is to transform the initial arrangement of blocks into a target arrangement using the minimum number of actions.
