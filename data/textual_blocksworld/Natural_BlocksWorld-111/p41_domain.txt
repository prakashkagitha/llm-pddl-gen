Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem characterized by a set of uniquely labeled blocks and a flat surface or table. The goal is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specified configuration from an initial arrangement. The main actions include picking up a block, putting a block down, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block. Constraints such as only being able to move one block at a time and the necessity of clear blocks (nothing on top of them) before they can be moved are fundamental to the problem. The game emphasizes sequential planning and problem-solving skills, involving states and state transitions as driven by specific actions to reach a desired goal state.
