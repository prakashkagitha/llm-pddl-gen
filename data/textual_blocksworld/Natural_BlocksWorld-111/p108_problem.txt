In this specific Blocksworld game, there are 12 blocks labeled A through L. The initial configuration is as follows: Blocks A, B, and C are stacked in that order (A on the table, B on A, C on B); D, E, and F are stacked similarly (D on the table, E on D, F on E); G and H are on the table side by side; and finally, blocks I, J, K, and L form another stack (with I on the table, J on I, K on J, and L on K). The goal configuration is to have all 12 blocks stacked in a single column in the specified order: L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A with L at the top and A at the bottom resting on the table.
