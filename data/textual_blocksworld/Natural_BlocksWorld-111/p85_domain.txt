Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain. The environment consists of a flat surface, typically called a table, and a collection of distinguishable blocks. Each block can either be on the table or on top of another block, and no block can be directly on top of more than one block at a time. The goal is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specific arrangement from a given starting state. There are several actions that can be performed: picking up a clear block with a robotic arm, putting a held block down on the table, stacking a held block on top of another clear block, and unstacking a block from another block to make it directly held by the robotic arm. The planning problem involves generating a sequence of these actions to transform the initial configuration of blocks into the goal configuration.
