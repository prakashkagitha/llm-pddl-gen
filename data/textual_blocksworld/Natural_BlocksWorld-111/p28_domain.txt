Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence that involves the manipulation of a set of blocks placed on a table. The objective is to achieve a goal configuration from an initial arrangement of blocks. Each block can either be on the table or stacked on top of another block. The key constraints are that only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if there is no other block on top of it (i.e., it is clear), and a block must be placed either on the table or on top of another clear block. The game state is usually represented through locations of all blocks and whether each block is clear or otherwise. This domain is utilized for testing and developing automated planning algorithms by illustrating simple yet computationally challenging problem scenarios.
