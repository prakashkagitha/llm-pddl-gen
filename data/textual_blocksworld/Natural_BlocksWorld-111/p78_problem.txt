You are playing the Blocksworld game with 8 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Here's the current setup: Block 6 is on the table with Block 1 on top of it. Block 5, Block 2, Block 7, and Block 4 are all directly on the table. Block 8 is sitting on top of Block 4, and Block 3 is on top of Block 8. Your arm is currently empty. Your task is to rearrange the blocks so that all blocks—Block 1, Block 6, Block 2, Block 3, Block 5, Block 4, Block 8, and Block 7—are on the table.
