Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research. It involves a finite set of blocks, typically distinguishable by unique labels, which are placed on a table or stacked upon each other. The table is considered an infinite plane where blocks can rest. The primary goal in Blocksworld is to transform the arrangement of blocks from an initial configuration to a desired goal configuration through a sequence of legal moves. Each move consists of either picking up one block from the top of a stack or the table and placing it on another block or back on the table. Key constraints in the game include that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it is not obstructed by another block above it. The challenge in Blocksworld lies in devising an efficient sequence of moves that achieves the target configuration while adhering to these constraints.
