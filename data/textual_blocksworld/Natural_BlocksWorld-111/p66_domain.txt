Blocksworld is a classic problem used in artificial intelligence research to study planning and problem-solving. The game consists of a set of blocks of different colors and sizes, which can be stacked on top of one another or placed on a table. The goal is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a desired goal configuration using a series of legal moves. Each move involves picking up a block and placing it either on another block or on the table. The constraints are that only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be picked up if there is no block on top of it, and a block can only be placed on another block or the table. The challenge lies in finding the sequence of moves that achieves the goal configuration in the most efficient way possible.
