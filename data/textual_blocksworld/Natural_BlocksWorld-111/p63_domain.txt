The Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem. It consists of a set of blocks of various shapes, sizes, and colors placed on a table. The primary objective is to rearrange these blocks from an initial configuration to a desired goal configuration using a robotic arm. The robotic arm can perform several actions such as picking up a block, putting a block down, and stacking a block on top of another block. The game assumes that only one block can be moved at a time and that the robotic arm can only manipulate blocks that are clear, meaning no other block is on top of them. The robot can hold at most one block at a time. The domain constraints ensure that blocks are never partially stacked and that the configurations are always valid at each step. The Blocksworld problem is often used to test and benchmark planning algorithms due to its simplicity and well-defined rules.
