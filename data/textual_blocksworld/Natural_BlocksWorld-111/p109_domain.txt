Blocksworld is a classic planning domain where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks arranged on a table. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table, and the actions available are to pick up a block, put down a block, and stack or unstack a block from another block. The domain assumes that only one block can be held at a time and that a block cannot be moved if there is another block on top of it.
