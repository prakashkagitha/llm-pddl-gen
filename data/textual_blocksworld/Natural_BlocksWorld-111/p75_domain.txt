Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research and involves manipulation of blocks. The game is played on a flat surface with a finite set of distinct blocks, each of which can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the surface. Blocks can be moved one at a time and only if there are no other blocks on top of them. The primary objective is typically to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a goal configuration. The actions allowed in the Blocksworld game include 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', 'stack a block on another block', and 'unstack a block from another block'. Each action must adhere to the rules of the game, ensuring that movements are legal and feasible within the constraints of the current block configuration. The game serves as a simplified model for understanding complex planning and problem-solving tasks.
