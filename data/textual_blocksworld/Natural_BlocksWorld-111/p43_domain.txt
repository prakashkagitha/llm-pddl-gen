Blocksworld is a classic problem in AI and planning which involves a set of blocks of different colors and sizes. These blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed individually on the table. The goal is to transform an initial arrangement of blocks into a desired goal arrangement, following certain rules. The environment consists of a flat table and a manipulator or robot arm that can pick up a single block at a time. Actions in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. The manipulator can only pick up a block that has no blocks on top of it, and it can place a block only on the table or on another block. The primary objective is to achieve the target configuration efficiently, typically with the fewest possible moves. The Blocksworld domain is utilized extensively in artificial intelligence research to study automated planning, problem-solving strategies, and to benchmark different planning algorithms.
