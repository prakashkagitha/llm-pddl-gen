Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem domain used to test planning and problem-solving systems. It consists of a set of uniquely identifiable blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The table serves as the base where blocks can sit when not stacked on another block. The primary actions in the Blocksworld game include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. Each action has preconditions and effects that dictate how the state of the world changes. The goal in the Blocksworld game is to transform an initial configuration of blocks into a desired goal configuration through a sequence of valid actions. The game represents key concepts in planning, such as state space, actions, goals, and problem-solving strategies.
