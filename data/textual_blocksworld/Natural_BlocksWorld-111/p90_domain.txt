Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, which involves a collection of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other. The primary objective is to create a specific arrangement of blocks from a given start configuration. In this domain, each block can either be on the table, on another block, or have another block on top of it. Blocks can only be moved one at a time and can only be picked up if there are no blocks on top of them. The operations typically include picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking one block on another. The goal is to explore and implement algorithms that can efficiently rearrange the blocks to achieve the desired final configuration while adhering to the defined set of rules.
