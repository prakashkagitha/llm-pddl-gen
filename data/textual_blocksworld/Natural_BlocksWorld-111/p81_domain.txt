Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem in which the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks that are placed on a table. The blocks can vary in numbers and are usually labeled with unique identifiers. The key actions allowed in Blocksworld include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The game typically starts with a random configuration of blocks, possibly stacked on top of one another, and the goal is to transform this initial arrangement into a specified target configuration. The challenge lies in determining the sequence of actions needed to achieve the desired structure from the current layout while adhering to the constraints that only one block can be moved at a time, a block can be placed only on top of another block or onto the table, and only the topmost block in any stack can be moved. This domain is popular in AI research, particularly in areas related to automated planning and reasoning.
