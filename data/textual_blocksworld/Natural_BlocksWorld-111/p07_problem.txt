In the Blocksworld game, you start with 10 blocks arranged as follows: Block 8 is on the table, Block 4 is on top of Block 8, Block 1 is on top of Block 4, and Block 2 is on top of Block 1. Separately, Block 9 is on the table, Block 3 is on the table with Block 6 on top of it, Block 7 is on the table, and Block 5 is on the table with Block 10 on top of it. Currently, your arm is empty. The goal is to move the blocks so that all 10 blocks—Block 5, Block 2, Block 10, Block 3, Block 8, Block 4, Block 6, Block 7, Block 1, and Block 9—are individually placed on the table.
