The Blocksworld game is a classic artificial intelligence problem where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration. The environment consists of a flat table and several blocks, each uniquely identified. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed individually on the table. The player can perform actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from a pile. All actions must abide by the constraint that a player can only manipulate one block at a time and can only interact with the topmost block in any stack. The initial state describes the starting configuration of the blocks, while the goal state specifies the desired end configuration. Solving Blocksworld problems typically involves determining a sequence of valid actions that transition the initial state to the goal state, utilizing planning and problem-solving techniques.
