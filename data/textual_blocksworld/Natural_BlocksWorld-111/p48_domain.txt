Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence problem used to study planning and robotic manipulation. The game involves a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other on a flat surface, typically referred to as a table. Each block can either be placed on the table or on another block, forming towers. The objective is to reconfigure the initial arrangement of the blocks into a specified goal arrangement, following a set of rules and constraints. These rules usually dictate that only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it, and a block can be placed either on the table or on another block. The challenge of Blocksworld lies in determining the sequence of moves that transforms the initial state to the goal state efficiently. This problem is of particular interest in the fields of AI planning and robotics, as it requires both strategic planning and the ability to manipulate objects in a constrained environment.
