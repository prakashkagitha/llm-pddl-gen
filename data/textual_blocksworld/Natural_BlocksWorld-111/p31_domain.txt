The Blocksworld domain is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and planning domains. It consists of a set of blocks and a table surface where the blocks can be stacked. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The objective is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration from a given initial configuration. The primary actions in this domain include picking up a block, putting a block down, stacking a block on top of another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Each block can only be moved if it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it. The actions are subject to constraints such as a block can only be held by one hand at a time, and the hand must be free to perform a pick-up action. This domain tests the efficiency and effectiveness of planning algorithms in arranging the blocks to match the desired goal state.
