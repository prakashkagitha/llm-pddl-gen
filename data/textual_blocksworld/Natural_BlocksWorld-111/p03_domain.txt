Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research. The domain consists of a set of distinct, stackable blocks and a table surface. Each block can either be on the table or on another block. The goal typically involves arranging the blocks in a specific configuration from a given initial configuration. Key actions in Blocksworld include 'pick up a block', 'put down a block', 'stack a block onto another block', and 'unstack a block from another block'. The game assumes only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be moved if it has no blocks on top of it. The simplicity of the rules belies the complexity of the problem, making it an enduring feature in AI problem-solving research.
