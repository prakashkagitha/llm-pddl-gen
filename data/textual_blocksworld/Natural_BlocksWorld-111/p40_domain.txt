Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain used to study automated reasoning and problem-solving. The game involves a set of blocks placed on a table, and the goal is to move the blocks around to achieve a specified configuration. Each block can either be on the table or on top of another block, and only one block can be moved at a time. Blocks can only be moved if they are clear, meaning there is no other block on top of them. Actions in the Blocksworld domain typically include picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on another block. The primary challenge is to find a sequence of actions that transforms the initial configuration of blocks into the goal configuration while adhering to the constraints.
