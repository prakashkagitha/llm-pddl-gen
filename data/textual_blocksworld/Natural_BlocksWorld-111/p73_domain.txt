Blocksworld is a classic planning problem domain used in artificial intelligence research, particularly in the study of automated planning, reinforcement learning, and problem-solving. It involves a set of uniquely labeled blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on a flat surface, typically referred to as the table. The primary goal is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks starting from an initial random arrangement by moving one block at a time according to certain rules. Each block can only be moved if it has no other block on top of it (i.e., it is clear). Blocks can be stacked directly on top of each other or placed directly onto the table. The key actions in Blocksworld include picking up a block, putting a block down on the table, and stacking a block on another block. The problem can vary in complexity based on the number of blocks and the nature of the goal configuration. This domain is widely studied because it encapsulates essential elements of planning problems, including goal setting, action sequencing, and state-space search.
