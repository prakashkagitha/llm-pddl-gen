In the Blocksworld game, you have a collection of 12 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Let's describe their initial arrangement. Block 9, Block 11, Block 2, Block 6, Block 4, and Block 1 are directly on the table. Block 10 is stacked on Block 11. Block 7 is on top of Block 10, followed by Block 5 on Block 7, then Block 12 on Block 5, and finally, Block 3 at the top of the stack on Block 12. Additionally, Block 8 is resting on Block 1. Your robotic arm is currently empty and ready to move the blocks around. The goal is to rearrange the blocks as follows: Block 11 should remain on the table, with Block 6 placed on top of it. Block 4 and Block 3 should each be placed directly on the table. Block 5 should go on top of Block 3. Block 10 and Block 12 should both be on the table. Block 9 will be placed on top of Block 12. Block 7 will be on the table with Block 2 on top of it, and finally, Block 8 should be placed on Block 2. Block 1 will remain directly on the table as well.
