Blocksworld is a classic problem domain in artificial intelligence and robotics, where the objective is to manipulate a set of blocks to achieve a specific configuration. The domain involves a table, a robot arm, and a number of uniquely labeled blocks. Each block can either be on the table, on top of another block, or held by the robot arm. The fundamental actions in this domain include picking up a block, putting down a block on the table, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The goal is to move the blocks from an initial arrangement to a desired target arrangement, adhering to the rules that the robot arm can hold only one block at a time and a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it.
