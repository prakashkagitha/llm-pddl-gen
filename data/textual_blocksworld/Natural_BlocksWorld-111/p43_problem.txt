In the Blocksworld game, you start with 12 blocks stacked in a particular configuration. Block 12 is at the bottom of a stack that includes Block 8 on top of it, followed by Block 3, then Block 6, Block 10, Block 1, Block 5, and finally Block 4 at the top. Separately, Block 9 is resting directly on the table. Another stack starts with Block 2 on the table, topped by Block 11, and then Block 7 at the top. Right now, your arm is free to move the blocks. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Blocks 6, 12, 1, 7, 3, 2, and 11 are all sitting directly on the table with nothing on them. Block 9 should be placed on top of Block 11. Meanwhile, Block 10 should have Block 8 on top of it, followed by Block 5, and finally Block 4 at the very top. By the end, this will leave you with several blocks in single layers on the table and a precise stack involving Blocks 10, 8, 5, and 4.
