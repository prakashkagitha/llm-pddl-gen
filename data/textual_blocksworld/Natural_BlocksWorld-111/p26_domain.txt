Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain involving a set of blocks placed on a table. The primary objective is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration. The game is played on a flat surface where blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed individually on the table. Each block can only be moved one at a time and cannot be moved if there is another block on top of it. The main actions in the game include picking up a block, placing a block on another block, and placing a block on the table. The initial state consists of a random arrangement of blocks, and the goal state is typically a specific arrangement defined by the player or system. Various constraints and rules, such as the prohibition of lifting more than one block at a time and the need for a clear surface before placing a block, guide the gameplay. The primary challenge in Blocksworld lies in devising a sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state efficiently, often requiring planning, problem-solving, and foresight.
