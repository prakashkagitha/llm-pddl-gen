The Blocksworld game involves a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or moved to the table. The primary objective is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks starting from an initial arrangement. Each block is unique and can only be either on the table, on another block, or have another block on top of it. The actions available in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block that has no other blocks on top of it, stacking a block onto another block, and placing a block on the table. The game requires careful planning to ensure that the desired configuration is reached efficiently. Constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be picked up or put down if there is no other block on top of it. The typical states in the game include the positions and relationships of blocks, whether they are on the table or another block, and which blocks are clear (having no other blocks on top).
