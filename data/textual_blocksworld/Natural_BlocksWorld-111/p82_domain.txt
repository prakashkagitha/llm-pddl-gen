Blocksworld is a simple planning domain used in artificial intelligence research and education to study decision-making, problem-solving, and automated planning. It consists of a set of blocks, typically labeled with different letters, which can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The goal is to reach a specified configuration of blocks from an initial configuration through a series of legal moves. The primary actions usually available in Blocksworld are picking up a block, putting down a block on the table, and stacking a block on another block. Some constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be picked up if it is clear (i.e., there are no other blocks on top of it). The simplicity of the rules combined with the potential complexity of the planning tasks makes Blocksworld an effective tool for studying the fundamental principles of automated planning and problem-solving.
