Blocksworld is a classic planning problem used in artificial intelligence research. In this problem, a set of blocks is placed on a table. The goal is to achieve a specific configuration of the blocks, usually by stacking them in a particular order. Each block has an individual identifier and can be manipulated under certain constraints. The primary operations include picking up a block, putting a block down on the table, and stacking one block on top of another. The problem is typically represented as a state space where each state is a specific arrangement of blocks. Transitions between states are governed by the possible actions or movements of the blocks. The challenge often involves determining the sequence of actions required to move from an initial state to the goal state, minimizing the number of moves or obeying specific rules regarding block manipulation. The critical constraints include only one block can be moved at a time, a block cannot be moved if there are other blocks on top of it, and blocks can only be put down on the table or on top of another block.
