In this Blocksworld game, you have 9 blocks initially arranged on the table as follows: Block 6, Block 9, Block 2, Block 7, Block 4, Block 5, Block 1, Block 8, and Block 3 are all sitting separately on the table. Additionally, your arm is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a specific tower configuration. Starting from the bottom and working your way to the top, the desired configuration is: Block 8 should be on the table, with Block 3 on top of Block 8, followed by Block 6 on Block 3. Next, Block 5 should be placed on top of Block 6, with Block 2 on Block 5. Block 1 should then be placed on Block 2, followed by Block 9 on Block 1. Finally, Block 4 should be placed on Block 9, and Block 7 should be perched on Block 4.
