Blocksworld is a classic problem used in artificial intelligence research, particularly in the fields of planning and robotics. It consists of a set of blocks of different sizes, shapes, or colors that can be stacked on top of each other on a table. The objective is to rearrange the blocks from a given start configuration to a desired goal configuration using a series of legal moves. The main actions available in Blocksworld are 'pick up a block,' 'put a block down on the table,' and 'stack a block on top of another block.' The rules are that a block can only be picked up if there is nothing on top of it, and a block can only be placed on the table or on another block that is clear of any other blocks. The challenge lies in finding the sequence of actions that lead from the initial configuration to the goal configuration efficiently, often optimizing for the least number of moves or minimizing the total time taken.
