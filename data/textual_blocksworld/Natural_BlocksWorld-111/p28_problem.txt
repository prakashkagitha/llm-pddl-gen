In this Blocksworld puzzle, you start with 9 blocks arranged as follows: Block 2, Block 4, Block 1, Block 8, Block 7, Block 3, and Block 5 are all on the table. Block 9 is stacked on top of Block 1, and Block 6 is on top of Block 9. Your task is to move the blocks so that all blocks—Block 7, Block 6, Block 9, Block 5, Block 1, Block 3, Block 4, Block 8, and Block 2—are each placed directly on the table. At the start, your arm is empty.
