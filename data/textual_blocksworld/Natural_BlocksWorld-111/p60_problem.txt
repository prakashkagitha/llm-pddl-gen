Imagine you have seven blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 3, Block 5, and Block 7 are on the table. Block 1 is stacked on top of Block 7, while Block 2, Block 6, and Block 4 are also each on the table. Your task is to arrange the blocks differently. In the new arrangement, Block 5 should remain on the table with Block 2 on top of it. Block 4 will be on the table with Block 7 placed on it. Block 6 will be stacked on Block 7, and Block 1 will be on top of Block 6. Lastly, Block 3 should stay on the table. Also, remember, your arm is currently empty.
