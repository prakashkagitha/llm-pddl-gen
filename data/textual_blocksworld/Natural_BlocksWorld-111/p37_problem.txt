In the game Blocksworld, you have 8 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Currently, Block 8, Block 2, Block 4, Block 7, Block 6, and Block 5 are directly on the table. Block 1 is placed on top of Block 4, and Block 3 is on top of Block 1. Your arm is currently empty and not holding any blocks. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 3, Block 5, Block 6, Block 2, Block 4, and Block 8 are all directly on the table. Additionally, Block 7 should be placed on top of Block 6, and Block 1 should be on top of Block 2.
