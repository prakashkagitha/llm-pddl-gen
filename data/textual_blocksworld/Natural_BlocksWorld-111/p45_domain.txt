The Blocksworld game is a classical AI planning problem. It consists of a set of blocks placed on a table, and a robotic arm that can pick up, stack, and unstack blocks. Each block can either be on the table, on another block, or being held by the robot. The goal is to move from an initial configuration of blocks to a desired goal configuration. The key actions in this domain are 'pick up a block from the table', 'put down a block on the table', 'pick up a block from another block', and 'stack a block on another block'. Actions are subject to constraints such as only one block can be held by the robot at a time, and a block can only be picked up if there are no blocks on top of it.
