You are playing the Blocksworld game, and you start with 11 blocks arranged in a specific way. Initially, Block 8 is on the table, and on top of it are Blocks 2, 5, and 7, in that order. Block 9 is on the table as well, with Blocks 10, 1, 3, 11, 4, and 6 stacked on top of it. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks to match a new configuration. In the new configuration, Block 7 should be on the table, with Blocks 4, 11, 2, 9, 5, 8, 10, 1, 3, and 6 stacked in that sequence. Your arm is currently empty. Can you rearrange the blocks to achieve the target configuration?
