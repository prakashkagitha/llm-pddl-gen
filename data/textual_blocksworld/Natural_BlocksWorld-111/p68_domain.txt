Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics. The environment consists of a set of blocks placed on a table. The blocks can be positioned in a stack, on top of one another, or moved around. The goal of the game is to achieve a specified configuration of blocks from a given initial configuration. The game involves several actions: moving a block from the table to another block, moving a block from another block to the table, and moving a block from one block to another block. Constraints include only one block can be moved at a time, and a block cannot be moved if another block is on top of it. The game tests problem-solving skills and the ability to plan a sequence of steps to achieve the desired goal.
