In this Blocksworld problem, we will consider a simple scenario with 2 blocks: Block1 and Block2. The initial state of the blocks is as follows:

**Initial State**:
- Block1 is on the table.
- Block2 is on Block1.

The goal is to achieve the following configuration:

**Goal State**:
- Block2 is on the table.
- Block1 is on the table.

To solve this problem, you will need to use the available actions to rearrange the blocks from the initial state to the goal state.
