You have a set of 13 blocks arranged as follows: Block 8 is positioned directly on the table. Similarly, Block 3 is also on the table, with Block 2 placed on top of it, and Block 1 stacked on Block 2. Meanwhile, Block 12 is on the table along with Block 13, on top of which lies Block 9. Block 6, Block 11, Block 7, Block 10, Block 5, and Block 4 are all on the table independently. At the start, your arm is empty. Your objective is to rearrange the blocks into this new configuration: Block 13 should remain on the table, as well as Block 6, Block 9, Block 7 (with Block 1 on Block 7 and Block 10 on Block 1), Block 4, and Block 12 (with Block 2 on Block 12). Block 5 should stay on the table, with Block 11 on Block 5, and Block 3 on Block 11, finally topped by Block 8.
