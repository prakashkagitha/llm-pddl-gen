In the Blocksworld game, you start with 15 blocks arranged in a specific manner. Block 1 is placed directly on the table, with Block 13 on top of it, followed by Block 15, Block 4, and finally Block 12 stacked on top. Separately, Block 14 is also on the table, with blocks stacked on it in the order: Block 8, Block 3, Block 5, Block 10, Block 9, Block 6, Block 11, and Block 7, with Block 2 on the very top. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks into a new configuration: Place Block 15, Block 4, Block 14, and Block 1 directly on the table. Stack Block 12 on Block 15, Block 6 on Block 14, and Block 3 on Block 6. On top of Block 3, place Block 2. Place Block 7 on Block 1 with Block 10 on top of it. Place Block 13 on the table with Block 5 on Block 13 and Block 8 on Block 5. Finally, place Block 11 directly on the table with Block 9 on top of it. You start with nothing in your hand.
