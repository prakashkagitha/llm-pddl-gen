Blocksworld is a classical planning problem used in artificial intelligence and operations research. The game consists of a table, a set of blocks, and a robot arm capable of manipulating the blocks. Each block can either be on the table or stacked on top of another block, and only one block can be moved at a time. The objective is to achieve a specified goal configuration of the blocks from an initial configuration. The robot arm can perform the following actions: pick up a block that is not covered by another block and place it either on the table or on another block. Constraints include that the robot can only hold one block at a time and a block placed on another must be directly on top of it without any other blocks in between. The challenge lies in planning a sequence of moves to reach the goal state, often requiring careful manipulation and intermediate steps.
