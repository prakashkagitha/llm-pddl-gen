In the Blocksworld domain, there is a table and several blocks of distinct colors that can be stacked upon one another. Blocks can only be moved if there is no other block on top of them, and they can be placed either on the table or on top of another block. The objective is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration by following a series of allowable moves.
