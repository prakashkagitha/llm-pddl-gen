The Blocksworld domain is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and planning. It consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robotic arm. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The goal is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks starting from an initial configuration. The main actions in this domain are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. Constraints include that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be moved if there are no blocks on top of it. The robotic arm can only hold one block at a time. The initial state, goal state, and the number and labels of blocks can vary depending on the specific instance of the problem.
