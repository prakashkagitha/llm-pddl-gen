Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain consisting of a set of blocks and a table. The objective is to manipulate the blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration, typically starting from an arbitrary initial arrangement. Each block can be either on the table, on another block, or available for manipulation by a robotic arm. The robotic arm can pick up a single block at a time and move it to another location. Additionally, there are constraints such as only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it, and the arm can only hold one block at a time. The game consists of a series of actions including picking up a block from another block or the table, and placing a block on another block or the table. The challenge lies in determining the sequence of actions needed to transition from the initial configuration of blocks to the goal configuration while adhering to the rules and constraints.
