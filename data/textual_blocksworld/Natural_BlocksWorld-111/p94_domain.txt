Blocksworld is a classic AI planning problem where the objective is to achieve a desired configuration of blocks stacked on top of each other. The domain consists of a table, a robotic arm, and an unspecified number of blocks that can be stacked on the table or on top of other blocks. The states in Blocksworld are configurations where each block is either on the table, on another block, or being held by the robotic arm. The initial state and the goal state are specific arrangements of blocks. Valid actions in this domain include picking up a block from the table or another block, putting down a block onto the table or another block, and unstacking a block from a stack. Each action has preconditions that must be satisfied for the action to be performed successfully. The ultimate objective is to transform the initial arrangement of blocks to match the goal arrangement through a series of legal moves.
