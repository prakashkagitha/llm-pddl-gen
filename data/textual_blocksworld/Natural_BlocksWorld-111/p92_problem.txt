You are playing the Blocksworld game and have a table with 11 blocks, all currently placed directly on the table. Your task is to rearrange them into a new configuration. Initially, the blocks are positioned as follows: Blocks 6, 3, 2, 11, 7, 9, 4, 1, 8, 10, and 5 are all on the table. Your arm is empty and ready to pick up blocks. The goal is to move the blocks so they are in this new arrangement: Block 2 should remain on the table, with Block 5 on top of it; Block 8 stays on the table; Block 11 stays on the table with Block 9 on top of it; Block 4 stays on the table; Block 1 stays on the table with Block 10 on top of it; Block 3 stays on the table; Block 6 stays on the table with Block 7 on top of it. Can you rearrange the blocks to achieve this new configuration?
