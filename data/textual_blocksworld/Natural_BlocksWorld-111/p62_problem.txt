You are playing the Blocksworld game and have 13 blocks arranged in a specific configuration. Here's the initial setup: Block 2 is on the table, Block 10 is on the table with Block 13 on top of it, Block 9 is on top of Block 13, and Block 1 is on Block 9. Block 4 is also on the table, with Block 7 placed on top of it. Block 11 is on the table too. Additionally, Block 5 is on the table with Block 12 on top of it. Lastly, Block 8 is on the table, with Block 6 on top of it, and Block 3 on top of Block 6. Your arm is currently empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 1 should be on the table with Block 6 on top of it, Block 3 on top of Block 6, and Block 9 on top of Block 3. Block 5 should be on top of Block 9. Also, Block 13 should be placed on the table with Block 7 on top of it. Block 11 should be on the table. Block 12 should be placed on the table with Block 10 on top of it. Block 8 should be on top of Block 10, and Block 2 should be on top of Block 8. Finally, Block 4 should be on top of Block 2. Can you rearrange the blocks to achieve this configuration?
