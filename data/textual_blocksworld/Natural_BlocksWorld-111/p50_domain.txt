The Blocksworld domain consists of a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Each block is uniquely identified and can either be on the table, on top of another block, or have another block on top of it. The primary objective is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks from an initial state, typically by moving one block at a time either to the table or onto another block. The main actions in this domain are: Move a block from the table to another block (if the block is clear), Move a block from another block to the table (if the block is clear), and Move a block from one block to another block (if both blocks involved are clear). A block is considered clear if there are no other blocks on top of it. The domain emphasizes basic concepts of spatial reasoning and planning as players or AI agents work to achieve the target configuration in an efficient manner.
