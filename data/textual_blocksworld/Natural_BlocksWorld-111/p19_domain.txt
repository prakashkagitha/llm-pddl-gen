The Blocksworld game is a classic problem in artificial intelligence that involves a set of blocks of different sizes, typically labeled with letters, and a flat surface. The main objective is to rearrange the blocks from an initial configuration to a desired goal configuration using a series of valid moves. These configurations are usually visualized by stacking blocks on top of one another and placing them side by side on the flat surface. Valid moves in the Blocksworld domain include picking up a block from the top of a stack and placing it either on the table or on top of another block. Constraints to consider are that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it. The game requires careful planning and strategy to anticipate future block positions and to avoid unnecessary moves. It serves as a benchmark in the study of automated planning and problem-solving techniques within artificial intelligence.
