Blocksworld is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics that involves a set of blocks placed on a table. The objective is to move the blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration using a robotic arm. A block can either be on the table or on top of another block, and it can only be moved if there is nothing on top of it. The robotic arm can pick up a block and place it either on the table or on another block, but it can handle only one block at a time. The configurations are represented as states, and the allowed operations are pick up, put down, stack, and unstack. The challenge is to find a sequence of operations that transforms the initial state into the goal state while following the rules.
