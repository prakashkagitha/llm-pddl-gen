Blocksworld Domain: The domain consists of a set of blocks and a table. Each block can either sit atop another block or be on the table. The operations you can perform include picking up a block from the table or another block, stacking a block on another block, and putting a block down on the table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a specific configuration by using these operations. The constraints are that only one block can be moved at a time and a block can only be picked up if it has no other blocks on top of it.
