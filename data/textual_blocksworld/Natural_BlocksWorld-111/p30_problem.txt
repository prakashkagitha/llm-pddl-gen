You are playing the Blocksworld game with 11 blocks. Currently, all blocks (Block 1 through Block 11) are placed individually on the table. Your arm is free to move blocks. The objective is to stack the blocks into a specific configuration: Block 11 should remain on the table. Place Block 8 on top of Block 11, followed by Block 2 on top of Block 8. Next, put Block 4 on Block 2, then Block 10 on Block 4. Continue by placing Block 1 on Block 10, Block 5 on Block 1, and Block 6 on Block 5. Follow this by stacking Block 3 on Block 6, Block 7 on Block 3, and finally, Block 9 on top of Block 7.
