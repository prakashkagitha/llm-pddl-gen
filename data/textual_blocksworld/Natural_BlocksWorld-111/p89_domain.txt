Blocksworld is a classic problem used in artificial intelligence research and robotics that involves manipulating a set of blocks of equal size lying on a flat surface. The objective is to achieve a certain configuration of the blocks from a given initial state. The blocks can be manipulated only one at a time, and can be either moved onto other blocks or placed on the flat surface. The main constraints include the following: only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if there is no block resting on it, and a block can only be placed either on the table or on another block if the destination block has no other blocks on top of it. In the Blocksworld domain, actions primarily include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking a block on another block, and unstacking a block from another block. The initial state is often random, and the goal state is either specified or generated to test different planning algorithms.
