Blocksworld is a puzzle game played with distinguishable blocks that can be stacked on top of one another or placed on the table. The objective is to reach a specific configuration of blocks from an initial arrangement by executing valid moves. Each block can either be on the table, on top of another block, or have another block on top of it. The game's primary challenge is to move one block at a time without violating the rules, which include: only one block can be moved at a time, a block can only be moved if there are no other blocks on top of it, and it can be relocated either onto another block or onto the table. The game typically involves an agent that performs actions based on a pre-defined plan or strategy to achieve the goal state.
