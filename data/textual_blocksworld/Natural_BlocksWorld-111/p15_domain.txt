The Blocksworld game consists of a collection of blocks placed on a flat surface. The goal is to move blocks to achieve a specified configuration. Blocks can be stacked on one another or placed directly on the table. An agent can perform actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, and stacking a block on top of another block. Each block can only be moved if it does not have another block on top of it. The initial state of the game is defined by the starting arrangement of the blocks on the table. The desired end state is defined by a specific arrangement that the player needs to achieve. The game ends when the blocks are arranged in the target configuration. Constraints include only being able to move one block at a time and ensuring that a block is either on the table or on top of another block. The game tests the player's problem-solving and planning abilities by requiring them to foresee the consequences of their actions and strategically sequence moves to achieve the target structure.
