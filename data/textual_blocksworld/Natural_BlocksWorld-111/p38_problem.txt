In the Blocksworld game, you initially have 9 blocks arranged as follows: Block 1 is on the table with Block 3 stacked on it. Separately, Block 9 is on the table with Block 7 on top of it, followed by Block 2, Block 5, Block 6, Block 8, and finally Block 4 at the top of the stack. Currently, your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 8 should be on the table with Block 9 on top. Additionally, Block 3 should be on the table with Block 2 on top of it. Blocks 6, 4, and 5 should all be on the table individually. Block 1 should be placed on top of Block 4, and Block 7 should be placed on top of Block 5.
