In the Blocksworld game, you have 15 blocks arranged in a specific way. Currently, Block 9 and Block 14 are on the table, with Block 2 resting on Block 14. Block 5, Block 12, Block 11, Block 15, Block 8, and Block 1 are also on the table. On top of Block 8 is Block 3. Block 1 has Block 7 on it, with Block 10 on top of Block 7. Block 6 sits on top of Block 10, and Block 13 is on top of Block 6. Lastly, Block 4 rests on the table, and your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks into a new configuration: Block 5 should be on the table with Block 14 on top of it, followed by Block 12 on Block 14, Block 4 on Block 12, and Block 8 on Block 4. Additionally, Block 2 needs to be on the table with Block 3 on top of it. Block 10 should be placed on Block 3, with Block 7 on Block 10, and Block 13 on Block 7. Block 6 should be placed on the table with Block 1 on top of it, Block 11 on Block 1, and Block 15 on Block 11. Lastly, Block 9 should remain on the table.
