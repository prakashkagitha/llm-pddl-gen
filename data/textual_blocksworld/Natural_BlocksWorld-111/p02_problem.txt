You have 11 blocks in the following arrangement: Block 1, Block 8, Block 2, and Block 11 are on the table. Block 7 is stacked on top of Block 11, and Block 10 is on top of Block 7. Block 6 is also on the table, with Block 3 on top of it. Similarly, Block 4 is on the table, with Block 5 on top of it, and Block 9 on top of Block 5. Your arm is currently empty. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into this final configuration: Block 3, Block 7, Block 5, Block 8, Block 10, Block 11, and Block 4 should all be on the table. Block 1 should be on top of Block 8, Block 6 should be on top of Block 1, Block 9 should be on top of Block 6, and Block 2 should be on top of Block 4.
