Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning problem where the goal is to manipulate a set of blocks stacked on a table to achieve a specific configuration. The game consists of the following components: 1. Blocks: A finite set of uniquely identifiable blocks, typically denoted by letters or numbers. 2. Table: A flat surface on which blocks can be stacked. The table can hold an unlimited number of blocks. 3. Actions: The possible actions are 'pick up a block', 'put a block on another block', and 'put a block on the table'. 4. Constraints: Only one block can be moved at a time, and a block can only be moved if it has no other blocks on top of it. The initial state describes the starting configuration of blocks and the goal state describes the desired configuration. The challenge is to find a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the goal state given the constraints.
