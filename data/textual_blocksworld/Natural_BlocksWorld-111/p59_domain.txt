Blocksworld is a classic AI planning domain involving a set of blocks on a table. In this environment, blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. The goal is typically to achieve a certain configuration of the blocks starting from a given initial configuration. The primary elements of the Blocksworld domain are blocks, the table, and the robot arm used to move blocks. Each block can either be on the table, on another block, or held by the robot arm. The robot arm can pick up a block from the table or from another block, and it can put a block down either on the table or on another block. This domain is used to study problem-solving, planning, and the effects of actions within constraints. Overall, the Blocksworld domain serves as a benchmark for testing planning algorithms and their efficiency in achieving desired block configurations.
