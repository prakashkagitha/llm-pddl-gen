The Blocksworld domain involves a collection of blocks placed on a table. The aim is to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specified goal configuration using a robot arm. The robot arm can pick up and move one block at a time. The key actions include picking up a block, placing a block on the table, and stacking one block on top of another. The constraints are that a block can only be picked up if it has no other block on top of it, and it can only be placed on another block or on the table.
