Blocksworld is a classic artificial intelligence planning domain that involves a set of blocks of various colors and sizes that are placed on a table or stacked on one another. The primary objective in Blocksworld is to arrange the blocks in a specified goal configuration starting from an initial state. Players can manipulate the blocks using a robotic arm, which can pick up, place, and stack blocks. Constraints include that a block can only be picked up if there are no other blocks on top of it, and it can only be placed either on the table or on another block that has no other blocks on it. The game tests planning, problem-solving, and the ability to anticipate the sequence of moves required to reach the goal configuration. The domain typically involves operations such as 'pick up block X', 'put block X on the table', and 'stack block X on block Y'. Blocksworld is commonly used to benchmark the performance of AI planning algorithms and to study concepts like state-space search and operator semantics.
