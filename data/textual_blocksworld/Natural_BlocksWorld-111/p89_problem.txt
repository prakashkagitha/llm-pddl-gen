You start with 6 blocks arranged as follows: Block 4 is sitting on the table. Block 5 is on top of Block 4, and Block 6 is on Block 5. Block 1 is resting on Block 6, with Block 2 on top of Block 1, and finally, Block 3 is on Block 2. At the moment, your arm is empty. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that Block 5, Block 1, Block 2, Block 4, and Block 3 are all directly on the table. Additionally, Block 6 should be positioned on top of Block 4.
