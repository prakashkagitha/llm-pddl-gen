As initial conditions I have that, block a is clear, block b is clear, block e is clear, block f is clear, arm-empty, block b is on top of block c, block e is on top of block d, block a block is on the table, block c block is on the table, block d block is on the table, and block f block is on the table.
My goal is to have that block a is on top of block b, block b is on top of block c, block e is on top of block f, block c is on the table, block d is on the table, and block f is on the table.
