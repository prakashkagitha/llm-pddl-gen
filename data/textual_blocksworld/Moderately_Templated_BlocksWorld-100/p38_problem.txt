As initial conditions I have that, block 1 is clear, block 2 is clear, block 3 is clear, block 4 is clear, the hand is empty, block 1 is on the table, block 2 is on the table, block 3 is on the table, and block 4 is on the table.
My goal is to have that block 2 is on top of block 3, block 4 is on top of block 1, block 1 is on the table, and block 3 is on the table.
