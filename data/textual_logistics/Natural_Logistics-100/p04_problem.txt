In this Logistics game, we start with three packages at each of three initial positions. Specifically, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, which is in city cit1. Similarly, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2 in city cit2, while obj31, obj32, and obj33 are located at pos3 in city cit3. We also have three trucks: tru1 is stationed at pos1, tru2 at pos2, and tru3 at pos3. Additionally, there are three airports: apt1 in city cit1, apt2 in city cit2, and apt3 in city cit3, with the airplane apn1 currently at apt3. The objective is to redistribute the packages such that obj33 and obj23 end up at apt1, obj11 arrives at pos3, obj32 is at pos1, obj13 is relocated to pos2, and both obj21 and obj12 are transferred to apt3.
