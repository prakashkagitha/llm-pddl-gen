In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can undertake: You can load a package onto a truck if the package and the truck are both present at the same location. Similarly, loading a package onto an airplane is possible when the package and the airplane are situated at the same location. When a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, the package is no longer considered to be at the original location. To unload a package, both the truck or airplane containing the package and the package itself must be at the same location. After unloading, the package will be at the location and is removed from the truck or airplane. Driving a truck between two locations is allowed only if the truck starts at the first location and both locations reside within the same city. Once driven, the truck relocates to the second location and is no longer in the first location. Flying an airplane from one airport to another requires that the airplane begins at the first airport. After the flight, the airplane will be positioned at the second airport, and it is no longer associated with the original airport. These actions must adhere to the described conditions to complete the transportation tasks in the game effectively.
