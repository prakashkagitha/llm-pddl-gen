In the Logistics game, we are dealing with several packages and transporting them to different locations using trucks and an airplane across four cities. Initially, we have twelve packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, and obj43. There are four trucks: tru1, tru2, tru3, and tru4, and a single airplane, apn1, which is stationed at airport apt1. The cities involved in the game are cit1, cit2, cit3, and cit4, and each city has its own location and airport. The locations are pos1, pos2, pos3, and pos4 paired with the airports apt1, apt2, apt3, and apt4 respectively. All starting positions are known: tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1 in city cit1, tru2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2 in city cit2, tru3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3 in city cit3, and tru4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4 in city cit4. Our objective is to redistribute these packages to new locations as follows: obj31 should be at pos1, obj23 at pos4, obj12 at pos4, obj21 at pos1, obj11 at apt1, obj41 at pos1, obj33 at pos1, obj22 at pos3, obj32 at apt3, obj42 at apt2, obj43 at apt4, and obj13 at apt2.
