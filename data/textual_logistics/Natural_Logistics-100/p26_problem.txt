In the Logistics game, I start with seven packages and thirteen cities. Each city has several locations and some also have airports. Specifically, I have packages labeled package1 through package7, and cities named city1 to city13. Additionally, I have several trucks and airplanes available to transport these packages. The trucks are labeled truck1 through truck23, while the planes are labeled plane1 through plane5. For the initial setup, planes and trucks are stationed in different locations within their respective cities. For example, plane1 is currently located at the airport in city2, while truck23 is at a location in city13. The packages are distributed as follows: package7 is at the airport in city1, package6 is at a location in city2, package5 is at the same location as truck20 in city10, package4 is at the airport in city5, package3 is at a location in city11, package2 is at the same location as truck21 in city11, and package1 is at a location in city4. My goal is to move these packages to specific destinations: package7 needs to reach a location in city12, package6 has to be delivered to a location in city9, package5 should be transported to the same location as package7 in city12, package4 is to be sent to the airport in city8, package3 needs to arrive at the airport in city13, package2 is to be delivered to a location in city7, and finally, package1 has to reach a location in city13.
