In the Logistics game, my task is to transport packages from one location to another, employing various actions. I have the ability to perform the following maneuvers: Firstly, I can load a package onto a truck when both are stationed at the same location. Similarly, I can also load a package onto an airplane, provided both the package and airplane are at the same location. Conversely, I have the option to unload a package from a truck at a specified location, but only if the truck, along with the package, is present there. The same applies when unloading from an airplane. Additionally, I can drive a truck from one point to another within the same city. An essential condition is that the truck must start at the first location and the destination must be within the same municipal boundaries. Furthermore, I can embark on airplane flights from one airport to another, with the requirement that my journey begins in the airport where my airplane is stationed. Thus, my challenge lies not only in selecting the most efficient sequence of actions but also in adhering strictly to these operational constraints to ensure successful package delivery.
