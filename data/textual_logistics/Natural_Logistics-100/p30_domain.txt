In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are present at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if the package and airplane are there. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered as being inside the vehicle and not at the original location anymore. To unload a package, ensure that both the vehicle (truck or airplane) and the package are at the desired location. After unloading, the package is considered to be at that location, no longer inside the vehicle. For truck navigation, you are allowed to drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, given the truck is at the initial location. Upon completion of this action, the truck relocates from the starting point to the target point within the city. When using airplanes, you can fly them between two airports, provided the airplane starts at the first airport. After the flight, the airplane is stationed at the destination airport, no longer at the departure point.
