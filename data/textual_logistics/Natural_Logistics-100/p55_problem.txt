In the logistics scenario, we start with the following conditions: We have a set of packages - obj11 through obj103. Additionally, there are several trucks named tru1 through tru10, as well as airplanes labeled apn1 through apn3. The game involves various cities, cit1 through cit10, each encompassing specific locations, both pos (positions) and apt (airports). Initially, packages are located as follows: obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, obj21, obj22, and obj23 at pos2, continuing similarly for all other packages up to obj103 at pos10. The trucks are correspondingly placed at these starting positions (e.g., tru1 is at pos1). The airports are distributed among the cities, with each city having one airport, such as apt1 in cit1, apt2 in cit2, and so on, up to apt10 in cit10. The airplanes begin as follows: apn1 is stationed at apt4, while both apn2 and apn3 are at apt3. Our ultimate objective is to achieve the following package distributions: obj53 should be placed at pos10, obj91 at pos10, obj93 at pos7, obj72 at apt4, obj92 at pos1, and obj13 should reach pos10. We also aim for obj73 to be at apt10, obj31 at pos10, obj51 at apt1, obj63 at pos5, while obj81 should move to apt7, and obj22 should be found at pos7. Likewise, obj11 needs to end up at pos10, obj71 at apt3, and obj41 at apt9. Furthermore, obj33 should be relocated to pos9, obj12 to pos3, obj83 to apt2, and obj43 should arrive at apt4, alongside obj103 which should be at pos6. Additionally, obj101 is intended to be at pos7, obj23 at pos5, and obj61 and obj62 at apt2. Finally, obj32 needs to be placed at apt6, obj52 at pos1, obj42 at pos10, obj102 at pos9, and obj82 should be settled at pos5. This organized and strategic movement of packages across cities, airports, and positions forms the core challenge of this logistics game.
