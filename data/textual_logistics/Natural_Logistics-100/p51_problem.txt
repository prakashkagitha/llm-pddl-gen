In the Logistics game, the initial setup includes several packages, trucks, cities, locations, and airports. Packages are labeled from obj11 to obj93, with various trucks from tru1 to tru9, and cities from cit1 to cit9. Each city contains specific locations, named as pos1 to pos9, and airports apt1 to apt9, with apt1 to apt9 designated as airports containing airplanes apn1 to apn3. Initially, apn1 and apn3 are stationed at airport apt9, while apn2 is located at apt4. Trucks and packages are placed at the corresponding positions: tru1 is at pos1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13; tru2 is at pos2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23, and so forth up to tru9 at pos9 containing obj91, obj92, and obj93. Each location pos1 to pos9 is situated within cities cit1 to cit9, respectively, as are the airports apt1 to apt9. The goal is to relocate certain packages to specific destinations: obj11 needs to be at apt6, obj93 at pos7, obj32 at apt3, obj92 at pos1, obj33 at pos8, obj23 at apt4, obj81 at pos6, obj63 at apt2, obj82 at pos9, obj83 at apt8, obj22 at apt4, obj53 at pos7, obj41 at apt6, obj62 at pos3, obj73 at apt9, obj31 at pos4, obj61 at apt9, obj43 at pos4, obj72 at apt4, obj42 at apt1, obj51 at apt7, obj52 at apt9, obj71 at pos2, obj13 at apt7, obj21 at pos2, obj91 at pos6, and obj12 at apt3.
