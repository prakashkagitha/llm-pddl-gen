In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations. You have several actions at your disposal to achieve this goal: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are present at the same location. Similarly, a package can be loaded onto an airplane, provided both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Keep in mind that once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer at the original location. To unload a package from either a truck or an airplane, the corresponding vehicle needs to be at the desired location, and the package must be inside it. Upon unloading, the package will now be at that location, exiting the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, but this can only be done if the truck is currently at the initial location. Upon completion of a drive, the truck will reside at the new location. For aircraft, flights can occur between airports, but the airplane must start at the initial airport. After completing a flight, the airplane relocates to the destination airport, no longer being at the origin point.
