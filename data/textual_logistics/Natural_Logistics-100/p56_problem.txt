In the logistics scenario, we have several objects and locations to manage. Initially, there are six packages: obj11, obj12, and obj13 located at pos1, and obj21, obj22, and obj23 located at pos2. In addition, there are two trucks: tru1 stationed at pos1 and tru2 stationed at pos2. Two cities, cit1 and cit2, contain various locations: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, and pos2 and apt2 in cit2. Apt1 and apt2 serve as the airports for their respective cities. An airplane, apn1, is located at apt2. The objective is to rearrange the packages as follows: move obj21 to apt2, obj12 to apt1, and leave obj13 at pos1. Ensure obj22 remains at pos2, while obj23 is relocated to apt2.
