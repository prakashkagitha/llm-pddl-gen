In the Logistics game, we start with a number of packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. The packages are labeled from obj11 to obj123, the trucks are labeled from tru1 to tru12, and the airplanes are labeled apn1, apn2, and apn3. There are also twelve cities, each with two locations: a posX location and an aptX airport, where X is the city number from 1 to 12. For example, the first city, cit1, contains pos1 and apt1. Initially, each truck is located at its corresponding posX location with three corresponding packages, and each airplane is stationed at a specific airport: apn1 is at apt11, apn2 is at apt9, and apn3 is at apt2. Our goal is to transport the packages to their designated destinations: obj61 to pos4, obj23 and obj21 to apt1, obj51 and obj81 to apt11, obj43 to apt9, obj123 and obj92 to pos1, obj73 to apt9, obj91 to pos11, obj53 to apt8, obj72 to pos8, obj82 to apt11, obj22 to pos1, obj62 to apt10, obj32 to apt10, obj121 to pos11, obj122 to apt8, obj71 to pos6, obj13 to apt7, obj113 to apt6, obj41 to pos8, obj33 to apt5, obj11 to apt11, obj63 to apt3, obj101 to apt11, obj83 to pos1, obj42 to apt8, obj12 to apt11, obj93 to apt2, obj112 to apt1, obj52 to apt7, obj111 to apt4, and obj102 to apt9. The goal is to move the packages efficiently to these locations using the trucks and airplanes available.
