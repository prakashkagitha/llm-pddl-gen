In the Logistics game, we start with the following initial conditions: We have several packages including obj11 through obj103, and trucks tru1 through tru10. Each package and truck is located in a specific position or city. We also have airplanes apn1, apn2, and apn3, where apn1 is currently at airport apt1, apn2 is at airport apt9, and apn3 is at airport apt6. Our goal is to rearrange these packages as follows: obj42 should be at pos10, obj63 at apt6, obj32 at pos7, obj11 at apt3, obj72 at pos7, obj31 at apt3, obj53 at pos4, obj43 at apt1, obj101 at apt6, obj91 at apt10, obj82 at pos1, obj102 at pos3, obj83 at apt6, obj73 at pos2, obj61 at apt 10, obj41 at pos7, obj93 at apt6, obj12 at apt3, obj23 at apt8, obj13 at pos9, obj51 at pos10, obj92 at apt3, obj33 at apt3, obj21 at apt3, obj103 at apt7, obj52 at pos6, obj71 at apt5, and obj22 at apt8. Each location including pos1 through pos10 and apt1 through apt10, is situated in various cities, from cit1 to cit10. All movements must be managed within these constraints to achieve the desired configuration.
