The Logistics game starts with several packages and vehicles distributed across different locations and cities. Initially, we have the following packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, and obj53. For transportation, there are five trucks named tru1, tru2, tru3, tru4, and tru5; two airplanes, apn1 and apn2; and five cities, cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, and cit5. Each city has its own location and airport: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, pos3 and apt3 in cit3, pos4 and apt4 in cit4, pos5 and apt5 in cit5. Initially, the airplanes are stationed at specific airports: apn1 is at apt5 and apn2 at apt2. Here's where everything starts: tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, is located at pos1; tru2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 at pos2; tru3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 at pos3; tru4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 at pos4; and tru5 with packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 at pos5. These locations are in their corresponding cities. Our goal is to move these packages as follows: obj22 should be moved to apt4, obj31 to apt4, obj43 to pos5, obj13 to apt1, obj23 to pos4, obj12 to pos2, obj51 to pos3, obj32 to pos3, obj11 to apt3, obj42 to apt2, obj52 to apt4, obj33 to apt3, obj21 to pos3, obj53 to apt2, and obj41 to apt1.
