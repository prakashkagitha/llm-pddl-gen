In the Logistics game, we begin with several packages and vehicles distributed across different cities and locations. The items are: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, and obj43. The vehicles include four trucks, tru1, tru2, tru3, and tru4, as well as one airplane, apn1. The cities are cit1, cit2, cit3, and cit4, each containing specific locations: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, pos3 and apt3 in cit3, and pos4 and apt4 in cit4. Initially, the airplane, apn1, is located at the airport apt2. The truck tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, are at location pos1. Similarly, truck tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3; and tru4 and packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4. The goal is to rearrange the packages as follows: obj43 should be at the airport apt4, obj32 at pos3, obj42 at apt3, obj12 should stay at pos1, obj41 should be transported to apt3, obj23 moved to pos3, obj13 sent to apt4, obj22 transferred to pos4, obj31 moved to apt3, and obj33 should end up at the airport apt1. The challenge is to strategically use the vehicles to achieve this goal.
