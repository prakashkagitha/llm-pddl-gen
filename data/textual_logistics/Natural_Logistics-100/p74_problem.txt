In the Logistics game, we have the following initial setup: There are packages labeled from obj11 to obj133, distributed across various cities and locations. We also have trucks labeled from tru1 to tru13, airplanes labeled from apn1 to apn4, and cities labeled from cit1 to cit13. Each city contains a specific location and an airport. The airplanes are initially positioned at certain airports: apn1 and apn4 at apt8, apn2 at apt3, and apn3 at apt1. Each truck, from tru1 to tru13, is located at a corresponding position, pos1 to pos13, along with three packages. For example, tru1, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, tru2, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2, and so on. Each position is situated within a city, pos1 in cit1, pos2 in cit2, etc., with each city also having an airport. The objective in this game is to achieve a specific arrangement where packages are relocated to designated locations or airports. Some goals include having obj83 at pos13, obj52 at pos6, obj33 at pos5, and obj13 at apt12, among others. The task involves strategically using the available trucks and airplanes to reach these target locations, thus achieving the game's goals with efficiency and precision.
