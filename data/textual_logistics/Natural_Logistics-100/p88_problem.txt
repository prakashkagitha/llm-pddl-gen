In the Logistics game, we have the following initial conditions: There are five packages, named package5, package4, package3, package2, and package1. Additionally, there are twenty-seven cities, labeled from city1 to city27. Each city contains several locations, and there are specific locations that serve as airports, identified by labels such as city1-4 and so on up to city27-4. We have fifty-five trucks and nine airplanes available for transporting packages. Each vehicle has a starting location. For example, plane9 is at city7-4, and truck55 is at city27-2. Each package is currently at a specific location: package5 is at city12-1, package4 is at city7-2, package3 is at city8-1, package2 is at city23-3, and package1 is at city1-4. The objective is to move each package to its target location. Specifically, you need to have package5 at city18-4, package4 at city10-3, package3 at city1-4, package2 at city14-3, and package1 at city9-2. The challenge is to efficiently utilize the available trucks and airplanes to achieve this goal.
