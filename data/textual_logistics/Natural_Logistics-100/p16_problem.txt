In the Logistics game, we start with a set of initial conditions involving packages, vehicles, and locations. We have packages identified as obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, and obj53. There are also five trucks (tru1, tru2, tru3, tru4, tru5) and two airplanes (apn1, apn2). The game features five cities (cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, cit5) and several locations including positions (pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4, pos5) and airports (apt1, apt2, apt3, apt4, apt5). Each airport (apt1, apt2, apt3, apt4, apt5) is marked as an airport location. Initially, airplane apn1 is located at airport apt2, and airplane apn2 is at airport apt1. Truck tru1 is at position pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Truck tru2 is at position pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. Truck tru3 is at position pos3 holding packages obj31, obj32, and obj33. Truck tru4 is at position pos4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43. Truck tru5 is at position pos5 along with packages obj51, obj52, and obj53. Each position (pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4, pos5) and respective airport (apt1, apt2, apt3, apt4, apt5) is located within a specific city (cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, cit5). The objective is to achieve a specific arrangement: package obj31 should be at airport apt1, obj12 at position pos3, obj23 at position pos5, obj11 at position pos5, obj43 at airport apt2, obj52 at airport apt4, obj13 at position pos4, obj53 at position pos1, obj33 at position pos1, obj32 at airport apt2, obj41 at airport apt3, obj51 at airport apt5, and obj22 at position pos2.
