In the Logistics game, I am dealing with various objects including packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. Initially, I have packages from obj11 to obj113, with each identified as a package. Similarly, I have trucks tru1 through tru11, each designated as a truck, and cities from cit1 to cit11. The game includes locations pos1 through pos11 and airports apt1 to apt11, with airports apt1 to apt11 additionally classified as airports. Airplanes apn1 to apn3 are also part of the game setup, specifically located as follows: apn1 is at apt9, apn2 is at apt5, and apn3 is at apt2. The trucks and packages are distributed such that tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2, and similarly for other trucks and their respective packages through pos11. Each position is within a different city, with pos1 in cit1 and so on up to pos11 in cit11. In the game's landscape, I aim to achieve specific deliveries, moving certain packages to designated locations. For example, obj31 needs to be at pos5, obj53 at apt10, obj42 at apt7, and so on, with each package having its own intended endpoint such as obj101 targeting apt9 and obj81 targeting apt6. Overall, this delicate orchestration involves coordinating various transportation modes to ensure that all these packages reach their rightful destinations.
