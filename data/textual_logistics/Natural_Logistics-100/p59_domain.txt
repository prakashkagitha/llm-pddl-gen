In the Logistics game, the goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck at a specified location, provided both the package and the truck are there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the plane are present at the location. Once a package is loaded onto either a truck or airplane, it is considered to be in transit and no longer available at its starting point. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the designated location, and the package must be aboard. Once the package is unloaded, it becomes available at that location. You can transport a truck from one location to another within the same city, ensuring the truck begins at the starting location. Once transferred, the truck assumes the new location. For airplanes, you can fly them between airports, provided the plane starts at the initial airport. After the flight, the airplane will reside at the new airport and no longer at the one it departed from. These rules ensure that packages are moved efficiently within the constraints of their respective environments.
