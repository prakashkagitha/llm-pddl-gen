Initially, I have a collection of packages and vehicles in a set number of cities and locations. Specifically, the packages are labeled from obj11 to obj103, the trucks from tru1 to tru10, the cities from cit1 to cit10, and the locations which include positional areas and airports from pos1 to pos10 and apt1 to apt10, respectively. Additionally, there are three airplanes named apn1, apn2, and apn3, located at airports apt8, apt3, and apt4, accordingly. Each city contains a position and an airport: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and so forth up to pos10 and apt10 in cit10. Each truck starts at their respective positions within the cities and is accompanied by a set of packages. For example, tru1 along with obj11, obj12, and obj13 is at pos1, tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 is at pos2, and this pattern continues until tru10 at pos10 with obj101, obj102, and obj103. My goal is to move these packages to specified final locations. I want obj83 at pos4, obj63 at pos7, obj101 also at pos7, and obj92 at pos3. Additionally, obj52 should reach pos10, obj43 at pos6, and obj82 at pos9. Other specific goals include obj72 to pos4, obj32 at apt8, and obj33 at apt5. The packages also need to be shifted so that obj81 ends up at pos4, obj13 at apt2, and obj42 at pos9. Moreover, obj21 should be at apt5, obj11 at apt1, and obj73 at pos1. The targets for obj62, obj41, obj12, obj93, obj22, obj102, obj53, obj61, obj51, obj71, obj23, and obj103 are apt3, pos7, apt6, pos5, pos9, apt4, pos2, apt2, apt2, pos7, apt5, and apt9 respectively. The challenge is to efficiently relocate all packages to their target destinations.
