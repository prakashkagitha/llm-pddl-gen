In the Logistics game, we start with a variety of packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. Initially, we have packages labeled from obj11 to obj113, eleven trucks from tru1 to tru11, and cities from cit1 to cit11. Each city contains two locations: a position point (e.g., pos1) and an airport (e.g., apt1), totaling twenty-two locations across all eleven cities. Airports apt1 through apt11 are available, and we have three airplanes apn1, apn2, and apn3 ready for use. They are stationed at apt10, apt9, and apt9, respectively. Currently, trucks and packages are positioned as follows: tru1, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1; tru2, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; tru3, obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3; tru4, obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4; tru5, obj51, obj52, and obj53 are at pos5; tru6, obj61, obj62, and obj63 are at pos6; tru7, obj71, obj72, and obj73 are at pos7; tru8, obj81, obj82, and obj83 are at pos8; tru9, obj91, obj92, and obj93 are at pos9; tru10, obj101, obj102, and obj103 are at pos10; tru11, obj111, obj112, and obj113 are at pos11. The positioning of each location within a city is as follows: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, pos4 and apt4 are in cit4, pos5 and apt5 are in cit5, pos6 and apt6 are in cit6, pos7 and apt7 are in cit7, pos8 and apt8 are in cit8, pos9 and apt9 are in cit9, pos10 and apt10 are in cit10, and pos11 and apt11 are in cit11. Our goal is to rearrange the packages so that: obj12 reaches pos6, obj32 and obj63 arrive at pos10, obj91 moves to apt7, obj102 is relocated to apt1, obj92 transfers to apt5, obj103 moves to pos8, obj11 reaches apt7, obj113 lands at pos2, obj22 stays at pos2, obj33 is transported to apt1, obj31 is positioned at pos1, obj42 appears at apt6, obj112 is relocated to apt11, obj101 settles at pos1, obj13 reaches apt6, obj71 moves to pos5, obj73 goes to pos6, obj41 will be found at pos1, obj93 is sent to apt6, obj21 is transported to apt9, obj51 reaches apt11, obj111 settles at pos4, obj61 arrives at pos3, obj43 moves to pos8, obj82 relocates to apt9, obj23 is transferred to pos8, obj72 is sent to apt5, obj81 goes to apt5, obj52 stays at pos2, and obj83 arrives at pos8.
