In the Logistics game, your goal is to efficiently transport packages between various locations. You have a set of actions available to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer available at the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle is at the location where you want the package to be delivered, and the package must currently be onboard. Once unloaded, the package is stationed at the location and is removed from the vehicle. Driving a truck between two locations requires the truck to be at the initial location, and both locations must be within the same city. After driving, the truck relocates to the destination and departs from the starting point. To fly an airplane, it must be positioned at the initial airport. Following the flight, the airplane arrives at the destination airport and is no longer at the departure point. Successfully managing these actions will allow you to move packages efficiently between locations.
