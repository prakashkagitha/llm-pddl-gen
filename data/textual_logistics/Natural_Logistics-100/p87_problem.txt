In the Logistics game, several packages and vehicles are initially located at different locations across three cities. Packages include package8, package7, package6, package5, package4, package3, package2, and package1. There are three cities involved, named city1, city2, and city3. The available transportation consists of trucks (truck1 through truck22) and airplanes (plane1 through plane6). Locations within these cities include designated areas (like city3-2 and city2-1) and airports (such as city1-3 and city2-3).

Initially, the airplanes are positioned as follows: plane6 is at city2-3, plane5 and plane1 are both stationed at city1-3, and planes 4, 3, and 2 are at city3-3 or city2-3. Regarding trucks: truck22 is at city3-2, trucks like truck21 and truck16 are at various city2 locations, whereas trucks 20, 18, and 13 are spread across city1 locations, and several others are in use around city3. Packages are spread across the cities too: for example, package8 is at city1-2, package7 is at city2-1, package6 is at city3-2, and package5 and package1 both start at city1-3.

The objective is to transport the packages to their designated destinations: package8 and package7 should arrive at city3-3, package6 needs to remain at city3-2, package5 at city1-3, package4 also at city3-3, package3 is to be moved to city1-2, package2 to city2-3, and package1 to city1-1.
