In the Logistics game scenario, we start with several initial conditions. There are seven packages labeled from obj11 to obj73, seven trucks named tru1 to tru7, seven cities named cit1 to cit7, and seven airports, apt1 through apt7, which also serve as locations. Trucks are stationed at positions pos1 through pos7, each in their respective cities cit1 to cit7, along with three packages per position. For example, truck tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, is situated at pos1 in city cit1. Similarly, the positions pos2 to pos7 in cities cit2 to cit7 are each associated with one truck and three packages. Additionally, we have two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, initially located at airports apt3 and apt5 respectively. The goal of the game is to transport these packages to their designated targets. These targets include obj61 reaching apt5, obj52 ending up at pos2, obj21 being delivered to apt5, and several other packages reaching specific airports or positions within or across the different cities. For example, obj13 should be at pos7, obj32 should arrive at apt5, and obj11 must be delivered to apt4. The task involves strategic planning of the movement and transport of these packages to meet the specified destinations efficiently.
