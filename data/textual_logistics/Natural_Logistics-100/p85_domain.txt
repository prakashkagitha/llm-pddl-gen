In the Logistics game, my objective is to efficiently transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's how I can manage the logistics operations: I am able to load a package onto a truck when both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, loading a package onto an airplane requires that both are located at the same point. After loading a package onto a truck or an airplane, it is no longer considered to be at the original location, as it is now part of the vehicle's cargo. Unloading a package from a truck or an airplane is possible only when the vehicle is stationed at a location and the package is within it. Upon unloading, the package becomes available at the current location and is no longer in the vehicle. For moving trucks, I may drive one from one place to another within the same city, provided that the truck is initially at the first location. Once driven, the truck transitions to the second location. In terms of air travel, I can pilot an airplane from one airport to another, but only if the airplane starts at the initial departure point. Once the flight concludes, the airplane resides at the destination airport and vacates the origin.
