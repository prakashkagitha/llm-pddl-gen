In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations. You can perform several actions to achieve this goal: You can load a package onto a truck when both the package and the truck are present at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if the package and airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer available at the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, the vehicle must be at the current location and contain the package. After unloading, the package will be at the location and not inside the transport vehicle anymore. Trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck is initially present at the starting location. Once the truck is driven, it moves to the destination and leaves the starting point. For airplanes, you can fly them between airports, but they must start at the first airport. After flying, the airplane reaches the second airport, vacating the first one. These are the operations and constraints you must consider while moving packages in this game.
