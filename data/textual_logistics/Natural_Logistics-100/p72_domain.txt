In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You have the following set of actions available to achieve this task: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, provided both the package and the truck are present at that location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if both the package and the airplane are there. Once you load a package into the truck or airplane, it is considered to be no longer at the original location. Likewise, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane, but only if the truck or airplane is present at the location and the package is inside it. After unloading, the package is now at that location and no longer inside the transportation vehicle. When it comes to moving your vehicles, you can drive a truck between two locations in the same city. However, you can only do this if the truck starts at the first location. Once moved, the truck is now at the second location and no longer at the first. For traveling longer distances, you can fly an airplane from one airport to another. You must ensure that the airplane is initially at the first airport to perform this action. After flying, the airplane arrives at the second airport and is no longer at the first. Use these actions strategically to move packages efficiently across different locations.
