In the Logistics game, we begin with several objects: Packages named obj11 to obj143, trucks named tru1 to tru14, cities named cit1 to cit14, locations named pos1 to pos14 and apt1 to apt14, with the apt locations serving as airports, and airplanes named apn1 to apn4. Initially, airplanes apn1 and apn2 are stationed at airport apt10, apn3 is at apt3, and apn4 is at apt9. Each truck, tru1 to tru14, is stationed at its respective location, pos1 to pos14, and similarly, packages obj11 to obj143 are aligned with their corresponding truck at each respective location. Each city houses one position and one airport. The locations are distributed as follows: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and so on up to pos14 and apt14 in cit14. Our goal is to distribute these packages across various positions and airports as follows: obj23 at pos7, obj131 at apt7, obj42 at apt14, obj21 at apt9, obj92 at apt4, obj62 at pos13, obj141 at apt11, obj123 at apt12, obj132 at apt8, obj52 at apt9, obj71 at apt1, obj51 at pos1, obj103 at apt8, obj72 at apt1, obj143 at pos13, obj122 at pos5, obj93 at apt3, obj101 at apt6, obj43 at pos11, obj13 at apt7, obj142 at apt2, obj112 at apt14, obj121 at apt7, obj113 at pos10, obj102 at pos13, obj33 at pos7, obj83 at pos6, obj22 at apt9, obj63 at apt1, obj53 at pos10, obj31 at apt9, obj111 at apt4, obj61 at pos9, obj12 at apt2, obj73 at pos1, obj91 at pos11, obj133 at apt9, obj81 at apt8, obj41 at pos14, and obj11 at pos9.
