In this logistics scenario, we begin with several objects and locations. Package obj11, obj12, and obj13 are initially at location pos1. Similarly, package obj21, obj22, and obj23 start at location pos2. We have two trucks: truck tru1 is stationed at pos1, and truck tru2 is at pos2. Additionally, we have a single airplane, apn1, which is located at airport apt2. Our map comprises two cities: cit1 and cit2. City cit1 contains location pos1 and airport apt1, while city cit2 includes location pos2 and airport apt2. The ultimate objective is to relocate package obj11 and obj13 to airport apt1 and to move package obj21 and obj23 to location pos1.
