In the Logistics game, we start with several packages and vehicles. Specifically, we have a range of packages: obj11 through obj143. We have a fleet of trucks named tru1 through tru14, and a few airplanes: apn1 through apn4. There are cities labeled cit1 through cit14, and within these cities, there are locations: pos1 through pos14 and airports apt1 through apt14. Initially, apn1 is at the airport apt11, apn2 is at apt6, apn3 is situated at apt3, and apn4 is at apt1. Trucks and packages are initially distributed across different locations: for example, tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1. Other similar distributions include tru2 at pos2 with obj21, obj22, obj23, and so forth, up to tru14 at pos14 with packages obj141, obj142, obj143. Each pos location is linked to a corresponding city, for instance, pos1 and apt1 are located in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, continuing this pattern through to pos14 and apt14 in cit14. Our mission is to mobilize these packages to specific destinations: obj32 needs to reach pos5; obj63 must arrive at apt9; obj141 is required at pos11; obj12 should be at pos10; obj112 needs to stay at apt11; obj11 should be moved to apt8, and so on for other packages requiring movement. The objective is to strategically transport all packages to their desired locations using the available trucks and airplanes effectively.
