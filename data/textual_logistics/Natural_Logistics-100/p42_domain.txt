In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck at a specified place by using the load-truck action. Similarly, with the load-airplane action, you can load a package onto an airplane if both are located at the same place. Once you load a package onto a vehicle, it is no longer available at its original location. When you need to unload a package, you can use unload-truck or unload-airplane actions, ensuring that the vehicle and package are both present at the unloading location. Upon unloading, the package shifts to the location and is no longer in the vehicle. Driving a truck is another option available; you can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, only if the truck is initially at the first location. After driving, the truck will be present at the new location instead of the original one. Additionally, for longer distances, you have the option to fly an airplane between two airports. To initiate a flight, the airplane must be present at the departure airport, and upon completion, it will be situated at the destination airport instead.
