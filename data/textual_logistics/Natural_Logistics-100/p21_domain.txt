In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have a set of specific actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck at a particular location, but only if both the package and the truck are at that location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location, provided both the package and the airplane are there. Once loaded, the package is no longer at the initial location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the desired location, and the package must be inside the truck or airplane. Once unloaded, the package becomes available at the location. Driving a truck involves moving it between two locations that are in the same city, only if the truck is initially at the first location. After driving, the truck is situated at the second location. Finally, you can fly an airplane between two airports, ensuring the airplane is currently at the departure airport. Once the flight is complete, the airplane arrives at the destination airport.
