In the Logistics game, the initial setup is as follows: There are six packages labeled obj11 to obj63, six trucks named tru1 to tru6, and six cities designated cit1 to cit6. Each city contains two locations: a normal position (pos1 to pos6) and an airport (apt1 to apt6). There are also two airplanes in the game, apn1 and apn2. Initially, apn1 is stationed at the airport in city 2 (apt2), while apn2 is at the airport in city 3 (apt3). Each truck is located at the corresponding position within its city; for instance, tru1 is at pos1 and so on up to tru6 at pos6. Similarly, each group of three packages starts at the position in the city corresponding to their truck number, like obj11, obj12, and obj13 at pos1, all the way through to obj61, obj62, and obj63 at pos6. The goal is to move the packages to new specified locations: obj63 must reach apt6, obj11 should go to apt1, obj41 needs to be at apt2, obj21 should remain at pos2, obj12 stays at pos1, obj51 needs to move to pos2, obj62 should be at pos1, obj61 at apt2, obj53 should move to pos3, obj42 needs to be at apt3, obj22 should shift to pos3, obj43 should go to pos2, obj23 needs to be at apt5, obj52 should remain at pos5, obj13 should end up at apt6, and finally, obj33, obj31, and obj32 should all remain at pos3.
