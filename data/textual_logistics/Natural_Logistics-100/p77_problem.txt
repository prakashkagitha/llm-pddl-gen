In the Logistics game, we have a set of initial conditions and a desired goal state. Initially, we have the following packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, obj83, obj91, obj92, obj93, obj101, obj102, obj103, obj111, obj112, obj113, obj121, obj122, obj123, obj131, obj132, obj133. Additionally, we have the following trucks: tru1 to tru13, and a fleet of airplanes: apn1, apn2, apn3, and apn4. Cities and their corresponding locations include: cit1 with pos1 and apt1; cit2 with pos2 and apt2; continuing sequentially up to cit13 with pos13 and apt13. Airports include apt1 to apt13 and airplanes can initially be found at: apn1 in apt6, apn2 in apt1, apn3 in apt2, and apn4 in apt1. Trucks and packages have initial positions within their respective city locations; for example, tru1 and obj11 to obj13 are at pos1, tru2 and obj21 to obj23 are at pos2, this continues up to tru13 having obj131 to obj133 at pos13. Positions and airports correspond to cities from cit1 through cit13. Our goal is to rearrange packages to specific targets: obj21 to apt3, obj62 to apt8, obj133 to apt10, and similar specific end locations for each package respectively. The remaining packages and trucks need to be arranged as follows: variously in airports, positions, or cities, as specified for each, ultimately organizing the logistics for efficient distribution.
