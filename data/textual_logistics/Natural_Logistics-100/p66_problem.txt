The initial setup for the Logistics game involves several packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. The following packages exist: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, obj83, obj91, obj92, obj93, obj101, obj102, obj103, obj111, obj112, obj113, obj121, obj122, and obj123. There are twelve trucks: tru1 through tru12. The game features twelve cities: cit1 to cit12, each containing a 'pos' location and an airport ('apt'). The positions (pos1 through pos12) and airports (apt1 through apt12) are mapped to their corresponding cities. Notably, airports apt1 through apt12 additionally serve as airports within their respective cities. Three airplanes, apn1, apn2, and apn3, are located at apt5, apt2, and apt1, respectively. The trucks (tru1 through tru12) and their corresponding packages are positioned at locations pos1 through pos12. Each positional location posX is in its respective city citX, and the airport aptX is also located in the same city citX.

Our goals for the Logistics game are to position the packages at targeted locations: Place obj82 at apt1, move obj103 to pos1, relocate obj101 to apt5, send obj31 to apt1, position obj11 at apt4, have obj43 at pos10, relocate obj42 to pos3, move obj12 to pos11, position obj112 at apt4, place obj83 at apt8, send obj22 to pos7, have obj53 remain at pos5, move obj41 to apt12, relocate obj123 to apt9, position obj93 at pos6, move obj32 to pos1, send obj113 to apt8, place obj23 at apt1, move obj13 to pos9, relocate obj52 to pos10, send obj33 to pos4, position obj63 at apt3, move obj121 to pos6, relocate obj91 to apt5, position obj51 at apt1, send obj21 to pos3, move obj81 to apt11, position obj111 at apt7, relocate obj62 to apt2, move obj122 to apt2, position obj92 at apt6, move obj71 to apt1, place obj73 at pos4, and lastly, relocate obj61 to pos10.
