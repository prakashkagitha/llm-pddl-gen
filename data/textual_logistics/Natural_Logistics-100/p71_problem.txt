In the Logistics game, we're starting with several packages, trucks, cities, locations, and airplanes. The initial setup includes packages like obj11, obj12, and obj13 at location pos1, and so on up to obj123 at pos12. Each of these packages is located in separate positions, all within their respective cities. There are trucks from tru1 to tru12, each parked at locations pos1 to pos12. Every city, from cit1 to cit12, contains a position and an airport, like pos1 and apt1 within cit1. This pattern continues for all other cities. Our airplanes, apn1, apn2, and apn3, are stationed at airports apt11, apt4, and apt5, respectively. Now, our goal is to reposition specific packages to new locations, such as moving obj103 to pos1, obj92 to pos11, and obj122 to apt12. Additionally, obj62 should be moved to pos3, while obj43 needs to be relocated to apt2, and a few other planned movements for packages to strategic positions or airports across various cities. Each repositioning, like obj111 moving to apt3 or obj51 to apt5, forms part of our elaborated logistics plan.
