In the Logistics game, I initially have the following conditions: All items labeled as 'obj' followed by two numbers are packages, such as obj11, obj12, etc. There are nine trucks, tru1 to tru9, and nine cities labeled cit1 to cit9. Each city contains two locations: a position labeled pos followed by a number and an airport labeled apt followed by the same number. For example, pos1 and apt1 are locations in cit1. Additionally, there are three airplanes: apn1, apn2, and apn3. Initially, apn1 is at apt9, apn2 is at apt5, and apn3 is at apt6. Each truck and package has specific starting locations. For instance, tru1, obj11, obj12, and obj13 start at pos1; tru2 and obj21, obj22, obj23 are at pos2, and so on for each truck and its corresponding packages up to truck 9. Each location posX corresponds to city citX and aptX. My goal is to move the packages to their designated destination locations. Specifically, I want obj23 to be at apt6, obj93 at apt3, obj92 at apt6, obj53 and obj52 at pos1, obj71 at pos4, obj31 at apt3, obj41 at pos4, obj11 at apt1, obj33 at pos3, obj12 at pos2, obj51 at pos7, obj32 at apt8, obj72 at apt8, obj63 at apt1, obj73 at apt2, obj81 at pos9, obj82 at apt2, obj83 at pos5, obj22 at apt8, obj62 at apt6, obj43 at pos2, obj42 at pos8, obj13 at apt7, obj91 at apt5, obj61 at apt4, and obj21 at pos2.
