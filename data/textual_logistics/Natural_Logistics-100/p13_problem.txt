In the Logistics game scenario, we start with several packages and vehicles distributed across cities and locations. Initially, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are packages located at position 1 (pos1) in city 1 (cit1). obj21, obj22, and obj23 are packages at position 2 (pos2) in city 2 (cit2). Similarly, obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at position 3 (pos3) in city 3 (cit3), while obj41, obj42, and obj43 are situated at position 4 (pos4) in city 4 (cit4). There are four trucks: tru1, which is at pos1; tru2 at pos2; tru3 at pos3, and tru4 at pos4. Additionally, there is one airplane, apn1, currently stationed at the airport in city 3 (apt3). Each city has designated locations and airports: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, and pos4 and apt4 are in cit4. Our goal is to redistribute the packages so that obj13 ends up at pos2, obj21 is relocated to apt3, obj42 remains at pos4, obj41 is moved to pos2, obj11 reaches apt2, obj22 is transferred to pos4, obj23 arrives at apt4, obj32 is moved to apt3, obj12 finds itself at apt3, obj33 ends up at pos2, and finally, obj43 is relocated to pos1.
