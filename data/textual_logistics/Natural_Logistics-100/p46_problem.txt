In the initial setup of the Logistics game, I have multiple objects including packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. Here are the specifics: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, and obj83 are all packages. Trucks are labeled tru1 through tru8. Cities are named cit1 through cit8. Each city contains two locations, with pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, continuing similarly up to pos8 and apt8 in cit8. Each 'apt' is also designated as an airport. Two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, are stationed; apn1 is at apt7 and apn2 is at apt5. Currently, the trucks are positioned at their respective 'pos' locations along with corresponding packages: tru1, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1; tru2, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; and so on in a similar fashion until tru8, obj81, obj82, and obj83 at pos8. 

The main objective of the game is to reposition the packages to specific target locations. The goals are as follows: obj11 should reach apt3, obj33 to apt5, obj72 to apt4, obj41 to pos8, obj81 to pos5, obj23 to apt8, obj13 to pos4, obj12 to pos3, obj83 to pos3, obj32 to pos7, obj42 to apt2, obj22 to apt5, obj71 to apt6, obj53 to apt3, obj82 to apt3, obj31 to apt7, obj61 to pos4, obj51 to apt8, obj52 to pos6, obj73 to apt4, obj43 to apt6, obj62 to apt3, obj21 to apt6, and obj63 to pos1.
