Initially, we have the following setup: there are six packages named obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. We also have two trucks, tru1 and tru2, and two cities, cit1 and cit2. Within these cities, there are locations: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, and pos2 and apt2 are in cit2. Both apt1 and apt2 are airports. Moreover, there is an airplane, apn1, located at apt1. In terms of package locations, truck tru1 is stationed at pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Meanwhile, truck tru2 is at pos2, accompanied by packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. The objective is to rearrange these packages such that obj12 and obj21 are located at apt2, obj23 is moved to apt1, obj22 stays at pos2, obj13 is relocated to pos2, and obj11 is relocated to apt2.
