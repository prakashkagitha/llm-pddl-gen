In the Logistics game, your goal is to efficiently move packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's how you can manage the logistics: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, but only if both the package and the vehicle are at that location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered to be with the vehicle and no longer at the initial location. To unload a package, ensure that both the vehicle and the package are present at the intended destination â€“ only then can the package be removed from the truck or airplane and placed at the location. When it comes to moving vehicles, you're able to drive a truck between two locations within the same city, provided that the truck starts at the initial location. Once driven, the truck moves to the second location. If you're using airplanes, remember that they can only fly between designated airports. The airplane must start at the first airport, and once flown, it will move and be stationed at the second airport. These rules form the backbone of managing your logistics operations and ensure that packages reach their destinations smoothly and efficiently.
