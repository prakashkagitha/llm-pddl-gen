In the Logistics game, players are tasked with moving packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Players can perform several actions: loading and unloading packages, driving trucks, and flying airplanes. To load a package onto a truck or airplane, both must be present at the same location. After loading, the package is considered to be in the vehicle and no longer at the original location. Conversely, packages can only be unloaded if the truck or airplane has arrived at the desired location, at which point the package moves from the vehicle to the location. Trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city, but only if the truck initially resides at the starting point. Once driven, the truck relocates to the destination. Airplanes operate between airports, with flights requiring that the airplane is initially stationed at the departure airport. After the flight, the airplane's new position is at the arrival airport.
