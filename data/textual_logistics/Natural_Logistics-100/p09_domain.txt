In the Logistics game, the objective is to move packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You have a set of actions available to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, provided that both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a vehicle, it is no longer considered to be at that location. Similarly, to unload a package from a truck or an airplane, the vehicle must be at the location, and the package must be inside it. Upon unloading, the package becomes available at the location and ceases to be in the vehicle. When it comes to moving the vehicles themselves, you can drive a truck from one location to another, as long as both locations are within the same city and the truck is initially at the starting location. After driving, the truck will be at the destination location. For airplanes, you can fly them between two airports only if the airplane is at the departure airport at the start of the action. Once you fly the airplane, it arrives at the destination airport and departs from the initial airport.
