In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between different locations. You have several actions available to help you achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck at a certain location, provided both the package and the truck are there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if both are present there. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer at the original location. You can also unload a package from a truck or an airplane at a location, as long as the vehicle and the package are present together there. After unloading, the package becomes available at that location. If you need to drive a truck between two locations within a city, make sure the truck is at the starting point and that both locations belong to the same city. After driving, the truck will be at the destination and no longer at the starting point. Lastly, you can fly an airplane between two airports only if the airplane is at the departure airport. Once flown, the airplane will then be located at the destination airport, leaving the departure point behind.
