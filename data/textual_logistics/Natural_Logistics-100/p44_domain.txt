The Logistics game involves transporting packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform the following actions: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, or load it onto an airplane if they are both at the same location. When a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at that location. To deliver a package, you can unload it from a truck or airplane, but only if the vehicle is at the designated location and the package is inside the vehicle. Upon unloading a package, it is now at that location and no longer inside the vehicle. To move a truck, you can drive it from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck is currently at the starting location. Once the truck is driven, it resides at the new location. Aircraft are meant for longer distances, and you can fly an airplane from one airport to another, given that the airplane is stationed at the initial airport. After flying, the airplane is situated at the destination airport.
