In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: 

1. To load a package onto a truck at a specific location, you must ensure both the package and the truck are present at that location.
2. Similarly, to load a package onto an airplane, both the package and the airplane must be at the same location.
3. For unloading, you can remove a package from a truck when both the truck and package are at the desired location.
4. Unloading from an airplane requires that both the airplane and the package are currently at a specific location.
5. You can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, given that the truck starts from the initial location and both locations are within city limits.
6. Flying an airplane is restricted to traveling between two airports, provided the airplane begins its journey at the first airport.

The rules governing these actions are straightforward: 
- Loading packages means they leave their original location and are placed onto the vehicle (truck or airplane).
- Unloading packages returns them to the ground location from the vehicle.
- Trucks must start from their current location to drive through city roads to a new location within the same city.
- Airplanes take off from their current airport and land in a new destination airport.
