In the Logistics game, your goal is to efficiently move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have a set of actions available to accomplish this task: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, packages can be loaded onto an airplane at a given location if both the package and the airplane are present. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at the initial location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle is at the designated location and the package is inside the vehicle. After unloading, the package is now at the location and no longer inside the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, but only if the truck begins at the first location. Upon driving, the truck is now located at the second location and is not at the first location anymore. Airplanes operate between airports, and a flight can occur if the airplane starts at the first airport. Once the airplane has flown, it is now situated at the second airport, leaving the first. These rules help outline the logistics operations you can perform in the game.
