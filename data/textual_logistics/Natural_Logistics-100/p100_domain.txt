The Logistics game involves moving packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You can carry out several actions to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane, provided both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Unloading works in the opposite manner, where you can only unload a package from a truck or airplane if they are both present at the unloading location. Once a package is loaded, it is no longer considered to be at the initial location until it is unloaded. For ground transportation, you can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, but only if the truck starts at the first location. Upon arrival, the truck is now considered to be at the new location. Air transportation involves flying an airplane from one airport to another, provided the airplane begins at the first airport. After the flight, the airplane is considered to be at the destination airport. All movements are contingent upon the starting conditions being met, ensuring a logical and realistic interaction with the logistics network.
