In this logistics scenario, we have several packages, vehicles, cities, and locations. Initially, packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at position pos1, while packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are located at position pos2. At position pos3, we have packages obj31, obj32, and obj33. Similarly, at position pos4, packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 can be found, and at position pos5, packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 are placed. We also have a fleet of trucks; truck tru1 is stationed at pos1, truck tru2 at pos2, truck tru3 at pos3, truck tru4 at pos4, and truck tru5 at pos5. There are five cities named cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, and cit5, each containing specific locations. In each city, there is both a position and an airport: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, pos4 and apt4 are in cit4, and pos5 and apt5 are in cit5. Airports apt1 through apt5 are also designated as airport locations. We have two airplanes at our disposal; airplane apn1 is located at airport apt2, and airplane apn2 is stationed at airport apt1. Our objective is to transport these packages such that obj31 reaches apt4, obj22 arrives at apt2, obj42 is delivered to apt4, and obj53 is sent to apt3. Additionally, we aim for obj12 to remain at pos1, obj32 to be transported to apt1, obj43 to arrive at apt3, and obj52 to reach apt1. Furthermore, obj51 should be moved to apt3, obj21 to apt4, obj11 to pos3, obj23 to pos4, and obj33 to pos3. Finally, obj13 should be delivered to apt3, and obj41 should be transferred to pos1.
