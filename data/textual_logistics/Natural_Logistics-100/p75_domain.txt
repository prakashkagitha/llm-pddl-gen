In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can take to accomplish this goal: You can load a package onto a truck at any given location, but only if both the package and the truck are present at that location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a specific location, provided that both the package and airplane are there. Once a package is loaded onto the truck or airplane, it is considered to be no longer at the loading site. To transfer a package from a truck or airplane, you must first ensure that the vehicle is present at the destination location, and only then can you unload the package, making it available at that location again. If you want to drive a truck from one location to another, the truck must start at the first location, and both locations must be within the same city. After the truck arrives at the second location, it is considered to have left the first location. Airplanes transport packages between airports. To fly an airplane, it must start at the first airport, and upon landing, it relocates to the second airport, leaving the first one behind.
