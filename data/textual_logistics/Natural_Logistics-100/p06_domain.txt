In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform several actions to achieve this goal: First, you can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, but only if both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once loaded, the package is no longer considered to be at that location. When it comes to unloading, you can only remove a package from a truck or an airplane if the vehicle is present at the location and the package is inside it. After unloading, the package is placed at the location and is no longer in the vehicle. To move trucks, you can drive from one location to another within the same city only if the truck is initially at the first location. Once driven, the truck will be in the second location and no longer at the first. For airplanes, you can fly them between airports, provided the airplane is initially at the departure airport. After the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport, leaving the departure airport behind.
