In the Logistics game, the initial setup is as follows: There are twelve packages (obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43) and four trucks (tru1, tru2, tru3, tru4). Additionally, there are four cities (cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4), each containing two locations: a position (pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4) and an airport (apt1, apt2, apt3, apt4). There is one airplane (apn1) located at airport apt1. Initially, truck tru1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 is at position pos1. Truck tru2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 is at position pos2. Truck tru3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 is at position pos3, and truck tru4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 is at position pos4. Each position is in its respective city: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, and pos4 and apt4 are in cit4. The goal is to achieve the following arrangement: obj13 should be at airport apt1, obj42 and obj43 should be at position pos4, obj31 should stay at position pos3, obj33 should move to position pos2, obj32 should be at airport apt4, obj21 should be at airport apt2, obj11 and obj12 should be at airport apt4, obj22 should remain at position pos2, obj41 should be at airport apt1, and obj23 should be at position pos4.
