In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform several actions to achieve this goal: You are allowed to load a package onto a truck or an airplane, provided that both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once a package is loaded, it leaves the current location and is considered to be inside the truck or airplane. To remove a package from a truck or airplane, you must ensure that both the vehicle and the package are at the designated location. After unloading, the package will be at that location, and it will no longer be inside the vehicle. When driving a truck, you can move it from one location to another within the same city, but the truck must start at the initial location. Once the truck reaches its destination in the city, it is no longer at the starting point. Similarly, flying an airplane requires starting from one airport and traveling to another. After arriving at the second airport, the airplane is no longer present at the first one. Remember, careful planning of your logistics is essential to successfully moving the packages to their intended destinations.
