In the Logistics game, I have several packages and vehicles distributed across different cities and locations. Initially, I have packages labeled obj11 through obj103 distributed in various positions. Similarly, there are trucks labeled tru1 through tru10, and airplanes apn1 through apn3. These vehicles and packages are situated in different cities, each having a position and an airport. The cities are labeled from cit1 to cit10. I've got specific locations like pos1 to pos10 and airports from apt1 to apt10, with their corresponding city affiliations as cit1 through cit10.

Currently, apn1 is stationed at apt1, apn2 at apt4, and apn3 at apt8. For the trucks, tru1 through tru10 are at pos1 through pos10 respectively, each with a few packages. For example, tru1 at pos1 has obj11, obj12, and obj13.

My goal is to reorganize these packages so that specific items are relocated to other designated positions. For instance, I want obj63 to remain at pos6, obj93 to move to apt2, and obj72 to relocate to pos8. Some packages need to change airports or positions, such as obj12 to apt10, obj92 to apt10, and obj41 to apt4. Other packages need adjustments similarly, with clear targets of either city, airport, or position outlined. I aim to achieve this distribution to meet the problemâ€™s requirements efficiently.
