In the Logistics game, the goal is to efficiently move packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's a breakdown of the available actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck at a certain place if both the package and the truck are present at that location. Similarly, loading a package onto an airplane at a location is only feasible if both the airplane and the package are there. Once a package is loaded into a truck or plane, it is no longer considered to be at the original location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the specified location, and the package must precisely be in that vehicle. After unloading, the package becomes part of the location and no longer remains in the vehicle. Driving a truck from one location to another within the same city is allowed if the truck is at the starting point. After driving, the truck is relocated to the destination and ceases to be at the starting point. For an airplane to fly between airports, the plane must initially be at the first airport. Once it flies, the airplane is relocated to the new airport. These actions must be carefully coordinated to transfer packages effectively from their initial positions to their intended destinations.
