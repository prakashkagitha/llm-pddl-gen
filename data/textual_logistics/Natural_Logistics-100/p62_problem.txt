In the initial setup of the Logistics game, we have several objects, including packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. The packages are labeled from obj11 to obj113, and the trucks are labeled from tru1 to tru11. The cities are denoted as cit1 to cit11, while locations are identified as pos1 to pos11 and airports as apt1 to apt11. The airplanes are named apn1 to apn3, with apn1 located at airport apt7, apn2 at apt6, and apn3 at apt4. Each truck is located at a designated position, with tru1 at pos1, tru2 at pos2, and so forth up to tru11 at pos11. Correspondingly, each package is initially located at these positions alongside trucks, for example, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1. Moving on to cities, each location and airport is situated within a specific city, such as pos1 and apt1 being within cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and so on until pos11 and apt11 in cit11. The objective of the game is to relocate certain packages to particular locations or airports. Specifically, obj62 should be moved to apt3, obj23 to apt5, obj13 to pos3, obj91 to apt5, and obj51 to pos6. Similarly, obj63 needs to be relocated to pos2, obj11 to apt10, obj52 to apt1, obj43 to apt2, obj72 to pos10, and obj31 to pos9. The plan also involves moving obj22 to pos4, obj12 to apt7, obj42 to pos8, obj81 to apt7, and obj82 to apt11, as well as obj41 to apt10, obj83 to apt4, obj21 to pos6, and obj73 to apt2. Additionally, obj111 should reach apt6, obj112 to apt10, obj71 back to pos7, obj32 to pos7, and obj103 to apt6. Furthermore, obj113 should be at apt2, obj33 at apt6, obj101 at apt2, and obj93 at pos5. Finally, obj53 needs to be at apt5, obj61 at pos8, and obj102 at pos11. The goal is to strategically transport these packages to their specified destinations within the game parameters.
