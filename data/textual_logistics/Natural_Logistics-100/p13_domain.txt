In the Logistics game, my objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. To achieve this, I have several actions at my disposal: I can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are present at the same location. Similarly, I can load a package onto an airplane provided both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded into a truck or an airplane, it is considered no longer present at the location. Conversely, I can unload a package from a truck if the truck is at a location, and the package is inside it. The same rule applies to unloading packages from an airplane. When I unload a package, it becomes available at the location and is no longer inside the truck or airplane. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, provided the truck is already at the starting location. After the drive, the truck is then at the new location and no longer at the starting point. Airplanes can be flown between airports if the airplane is stationed at the departing airport. Upon completion of the flight, the airplane arrives at the destination airport and is no longer at the departing airport.
