In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if the package and airplane are at that location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it will no longer be at the original location. You have the ability to unload a package from a truck at a location, provided the truck is at that location and the package is inside it. The same applies to airplanes - you can unload a package from an airplane when the airplane is at the location and the package is onboard. After unloading, the package will be at the location and no longer in the truck or airplane. For ground transport, you can drive a truck between two locations within a city, but only if the truck is initially at the first location and both locations are in the same city. Following the drive, the truck will be at the second location. For air travel, you can fly an airplane from one airport to another, starting only if the airplane is at the first airport. After the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport. These constraints ensure that the logistics operations are grounded in realistic scenarios, requiring strategic planning to optimize package delivery.
