In the Logistics game, your objective is to efficiently move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the key actions you can perform: Load a package onto a truck at a specific location by ensuring both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are located at the same spot. Once you load a package onto a truck or airplane, the package is considered to have left the original location. On the other hand, unloading a package from a truck or an airplane requires the vehicle and the package to be at the designated location; once unloaded, the package is placed at the location. Driving a truck from one location to another within the same city is possible only if the truck starts at the initial location and both places are within the same city limits. After driving, the truck is considered to have moved to the new location. Flying an airplane requires it to be at the starting airport, and once flown, it relocates to the destination airport, thus leaving the original airport behind. These actions ensure that packages are systematically transported while adhering to the logistical constraints of location and vehicle availability.
