In the logistics game, we begin with the following setup: There are packages labeled from obj11 to obj103, totaling 30 packages. Additionally, there are 10 trucks labeled tru1 to tru10, 10 cities labeled cit1 to cit10, and 10 airports labeled apt1 to apt10. Each city contains a position and an airport. We also have three airplanes, labeled apn1, apn2, and apn3. These airplanes are located at apt3, apt8, and apt6 respectively. Trucks and packages are initially located at specific city positions: for instance, tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, are at pos1. Similarly, tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2, and so on, up to tru10 and obj101, obj102, and obj103 at pos10. Each position and airport belongs to one of the cities. For our goal, we need to move these packages to specific new locations. Our objectives are as follows: package obj42 must be at pos10, obj103 at pos2, obj61 at apt10, and so on. This series of moves and redirections involves various combinations of positions, airports, and cities. The goal is to relocate all the specified objects to their target locations accurately.
