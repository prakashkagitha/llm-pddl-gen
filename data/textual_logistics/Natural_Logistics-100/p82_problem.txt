In the Logistics game, we have several initial conditions: Packages are distributed across different trucks and locations. Packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at location pos1 with truck tru1. Packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at location pos2 with truck tru2. Packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at location pos3 with truck tru3. This pattern continues up to packages obj141, obj142, and obj143 at location pos14 with truck tru14. Each location is associated with a specific city, so pos1 and airport apt1 are in city cit1, pos2 and airport apt2 are in city cit2, and so forth, up to pos14 and airport apt14 in city cit14. Additionally, there are four airplanes: apn1 is currently at airport apt8, apn2 at apt9, apn3 at apt4, and apn4 at apt12. Our objective is to transport these packages to new destinations. Specifically, we want obj52 at airport apt13, obj101 at airport apt10, obj42 at location apt11, obj83 at pos14, obj143 at pos11, obj91 at pos5, obj41 at apt14, and continue this relocation for all listed packages. Each package has a specific new target location, either an airport or a position in one of the cities.
