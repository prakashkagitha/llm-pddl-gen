In the Logistics game, the initial setup includes several objects and their locations. We have packages labeled obj11 to obj63, spanning six different trucks from tru1 to tru6, and six cities named cit1 to cit6. The cities each contain two locations: a position (pos1 to pos6) and an airport (apt1 to apt6). Two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, are stationed at apt2 and apt6, respectively. The current state is as follows: Truck tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are located at pos1; truck tru2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; similarly, truck tru3 with obj31, obj32, and obj33 is at pos3; truck tru4 and packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4; tru5 with obj51, obj52, and obj53 is at pos5; and finally, tru6 with obj61, obj62, and obj63 is at pos6. The specific connections within cities include pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, pos3 and apt3 in cit3, pos4 and apt4 in cit4, pos5 and apt5 in cit5, and pos6 and apt6 in cit6. Our objective is to reposition these packages as follows: obj13 to apt6, obj32 to apt5, obj43 to pos2, obj61 to apt1, obj22 to pos6, obj51 to pos4, obj11 to pos2, obj33 to pos6, obj62 to apt1, obj12 to apt1, obj41 to pos1, obj63 to pos3, obj52 to pos2, obj23 to pos5, obj42 to pos2, obj31 to pos4, obj21 to pos4, and obj53 to pos2.
