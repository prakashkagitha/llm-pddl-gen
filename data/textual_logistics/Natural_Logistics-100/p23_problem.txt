Initially, we have several packages and vehicles to manage. The packages include obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. We also have two trucks, tru1 and tru2, as well as an airplane, apn1. The cities involved are cit1 and cit2, each containing specific locations. In cit1, there is a location called pos1 and an airport called apt1, while in cit2, there is a location called pos2 and an airport called apt2. Currently, apn1 is stationed at apt1, tru1 is at pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, and tru2 is at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. The locations pos1 and apt1 are within cit1, while pos2 and apt2 are within cit2. The goal is to transport the packages appropriately to fulfill certain conditions: package obj21 should be moved to apt1, obj11 should be relocated to pos2, obj23 should remain at pos2, and obj12 should stay at pos1.
