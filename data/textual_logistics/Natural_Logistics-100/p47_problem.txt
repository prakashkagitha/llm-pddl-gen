In the Logistics game, we have the following initial conditions: There are nine packages, nine trucks, nine cities, nine locations, nine airports, and three airplanes. Specifically, the packages are named obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, obj83, obj91, obj92, and obj93. The trucks are called tru1 through tru9. The cities are cit1 through cit9, and each city contains a position (pos1 through pos9) and an airport (apt1 through apt9). The airplanes, named apn1, apn2, apn3, are located at airports apt6, apt1, and apt6, respectively. Initially, each truck is located at a specific position along with some packages: tru1 with obj11, obj12, obj13 at pos1; tru2 with obj21, obj22, obj23 at pos2; tru3 with obj31, obj32, obj33 at pos3; tru4 with obj41, obj42, obj43 at pos4; tru5 with obj51, obj52, obj53 at pos5; tru6 with obj61, obj62, obj63 at pos6; tru7 with obj71, obj72, obj73 at pos7; tru8 with obj81, obj82, obj83 at pos8; tru9 with obj91, obj92, obj93 at pos9. The positions and airports are distributed across the cities consistently such that posX and aptX are both in citX for X being any number from 1 to 9. Our goal is to rearrange the packages so that obj12 is at pos7, obj51 at apt7, obj81 at apt8, obj61 at pos3, obj22 at pos6, obj41 at pos8, obj62 at apt3, obj63 at pos4, obj32 at apt2, obj52 at pos3, obj91 at apt7, obj21 at pos5, obj11 at apt4, obj92 at apt8, obj71 and obj72 at apt6, obj13 at apt9, obj82 and obj83 at pos3, obj43 at apt4, obj23 at pos9, obj53 at pos4, obj33 and obj73 at pos8, and obj31 at pos3.
