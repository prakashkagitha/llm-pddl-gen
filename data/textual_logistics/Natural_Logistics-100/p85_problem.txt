In the Logistics game, we start with six packages and six cities. Each city has a truck and both a normal location and an airport. City 6 through City 1 are home to Truck 6 to Truck 1 respectively. There are two airplanes initially stationed at the airport in City 4. The packages are distributed across the cities: Package 6 is currently located in the standard location of City 3, Package 5 is at the airport in City 4, and both Package 4 and Package 3 are in the standard location of City 1. Meanwhile, Package 2 is at the airport in City 1, and Package 1 is in the standard location of City 2. The challenge is to rearrange these packages to achieve the following goal: Package 6 should be delivered to the airport in City 1, Package 5 to the airport of City 6, Package 4 to the airport in City 3, Package 3 to the standard location of City 6, Package 2 to the airport in City 6, and Package 1 remains at the standard location of City 2.
