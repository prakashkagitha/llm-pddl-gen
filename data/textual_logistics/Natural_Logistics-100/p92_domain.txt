In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform the following actions: You can load a package onto a truck when both the package and the truck are currently at the same location. Similarly, a package can be loaded onto an airplane only if both are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it ceases to be at the original location as it is now inside the vehicle. To unload the package, ensure that both the vehicle and the package are at the desired location. When successfully unloaded, the package will be at the location and no longer inside the truck or airplane. Driving a truck between locations is possible only if the truck is at the initial location and both locations are within the same city. Upon driving, the truck moves to the new location and leaves the original one. Flying an airplane is restricted between two airports, and for this action, the airplane must commence its journey from the first airport. Upon arrival, the airplane relocates from the departing airport to the destination airport.
