In this Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations. To achieve this, you can perform the following actions: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, provided that both the package and the vehicle are present at the same location. Once loaded, the package will no longer be at that location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle and the package are both at the intended location. Post unloading, the package will be at the location and no longer within the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, but the truck must begin its journey from the first location. After driving, the truck will reside in the second location. Airplanes can be used for flights, moving from one airport to another, but they must start at the initial airport. Following a flight, the airplane will be stationed at the destination airport.
