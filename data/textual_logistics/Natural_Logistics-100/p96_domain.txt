In the Logistics game, your objective is to efficiently transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's how you can execute this mission: 

1. **Loading Packages:** 
   - You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, but ensure both the package and the truck are present there. 
   - Similarly, to load a package onto an airplane, both the package and the plane must be at the same location. 
   - After loading a package onto a truck or airplane, the package is no longer at the original location as it has been transferred onto the vehicle.

2. **Unloading Packages:** 
   - A package can be unloaded from a truck at a location only if both the truck and the package are currently there. 
   - Likewise, to unload a package from an airplane, both the airplane and the package need to be at that specific location. 
   - Upon unloading, the package is now situated at the location and is no longer inside the vehicle.

3. **Driving Trucks:** 
   - Drive a truck from one location to another, but keep in mind both locations must be within the same city. 
   - The truck needs to start at the first location, and once driven, it will be at the second location, no longer at the starting point.

4. **Flying Airplanes:** 
   - Airplanes can only travel between airports. Ensure the airplane is at the departing airport to begin the journey. 
   - Once the airplane takes off, it arrives at the destination airport and is no longer at the departure point.

These actions are governed by certain restrictions to maintain efficient logistics operations. Happy transporting!
