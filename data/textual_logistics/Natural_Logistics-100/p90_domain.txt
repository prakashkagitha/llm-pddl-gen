In the Logistics game, the goal is to move packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are located at the same place. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Keep in mind that once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at its original location. Similarly, unloading a package from a truck or airplane requires that the vehicle is at the same location as where you want the package to be unloaded, and the package must be currently inside the vehicle. After unloading, the package will be at the new location and will not be in the vehicle anymore. Trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city, provided the truck starts at the first location. Once driven, the truck will be at the destination location and no longer at the starting point. In terms of air travel, airplanes can be flown between two airports if the airplane begins its journey at the initial airport. Again, once flown, the airplane arrives at the second airport and departs from the first one. Remember, these movements adhere to specific rules ensuring that packages, trucks, and airplanes are at their rightful places as the game progresses.
