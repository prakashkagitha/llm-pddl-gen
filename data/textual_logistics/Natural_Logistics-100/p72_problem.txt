In the Logistics game, we begin with a variety of initial conditions. There are twelve trucks and twelve cities. Each city has two locations: a regular location and an airport. All airports are labeled from apt1 to apt12, and all positions are labeled from pos1 to pos12. Additionally, there are three packages assigned to each city, totaling 36 packages, which range from obj11 to obj123. There are also three airplanes labeled apn1, apn2, and apn3, initially located at apt3 and apt9, with apn1 at apt3 and both apn2 and apn3 at apt9. Each truck is at a respective position with truck tru1 at pos1 carrying packages obj11, obj12, and obj13; truck tru2 at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23; truck tru3 at pos3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33, and so on up to truck tru12 at pos12 with obj121, obj122, and obj123. Each position, pos1 to pos12, is located in its respective city, cit1 to cit12. Our goal is to rearrange these packages to the following destinations: obj32 should be at pos5, obj101 at pos6, obj21 at pos5, obj61 at pos1, obj12 at pos7, obj112 at pos9, obj13 at pos2, obj51 at pos4, obj82 at apt8, obj113 at apt9, obj103 at pos9, obj123 at apt10, obj102 at apt6, obj33 at apt12, obj72 at pos2, obj52 at apt11, obj11 at pos4, obj53 at apt8, obj31 at pos2, obj111 at pos11, obj93 at apt2, obj122 at pos5, obj43 at pos12, obj41 at pos3, obj63 at apt6, obj62 at pos4, obj92 at pos4, obj22 at pos2, obj23 at apt8, obj71 at pos8, obj81 at pos2, obj91 at apt4, obj121 at apt7, obj73 at pos2, obj42 at pos6, and obj83 at apt2.
