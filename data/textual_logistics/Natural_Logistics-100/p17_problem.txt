In a logistics scenario, we have several packages and vehicles located in different cities and locations. Initially, there are packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 located at position pos1 with truck tru1 in city cit1. In city cit2, at position pos2, we have packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 along with truck tru2. Similarly, in city cit3 at position pos3, truck tru3 is co-located with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33. City cit4 has truck tru4 and packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 at position pos4, while city cit5 contains truck tru5 with packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 at position pos5. Each city also has an airport; apt1 is in cit1, apt2 in cit2, apt3 in cit3, apt4 in cit4, and apt5 in cit5. Two airplanes are part of this scenario: airplane apn1 is at airport apt4, and airplane apn2 is located at airport apt2. The goal is to move these packages such that obj12 ends up at pos2, obj53 is transferred to apt2, obj51 relocates to pos4, obj11 remains at pos1, obj23 is transported to apt1, obj13 moves to pos5, obj52 is at apt4, obj42 relocates to pos3, obj22 is moved to pos1, obj33 goes to apt4, obj21 is at apt2, obj41 remains at pos4, and obj31 stays at pos3.
