In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Hereâ€™s how you can perform these actions: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, or onto an airplane if it's at an airport, provided both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once a package is loaded, it will be inside the truck or airplane and no longer at the location. Similarly, you can unload a package from a truck at a location or from an airplane at an airport, but only if the vehicle is there and the package is inside. After unloading, the package will be at the location and not inside the vehicle. Driving a truck involves transporting it between two locations within the same city, but only if the truck starts at the initial location. Once driven, the truck will be at the destination location, not at the starting point. Flying involves moving an airplane between two airports, beginning with the airplane at the first airport. Upon landing, the airplane will be situated at the destination airport, not the departure airport.
