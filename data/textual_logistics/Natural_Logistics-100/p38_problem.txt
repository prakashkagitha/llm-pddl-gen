In the logistics game, we have several objects, cities, and locations to manage. Initially, we have the following packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, and obj73. For transportation, there are trucks named tru1, tru2, tru3, tru4, tru5, tru6, and tru7, as well as airplanes, apn1 and apn2. The cities in our scenario are cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, cit5, cit6, and cit7, and each city has a position and an airport respective to them, such as pos1 and apt1 for cit1, and so forth up to pos7 and apt7 for cit7. At the start of the game, airplanes have particular starting locations, with apn1 at apt6 and apn2 at apt3. Trucks and packages are initially located as follows: tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1; tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 stand at pos3. This pattern continues similarly for all trucks, packages, and positions up to tru7 at pos7 with packages obj71, obj72, and obj73. The locations and their respective cities are succinctly mapped as: pos1 and apt1 lie in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, and so forth up to pos7 and apt7 in cit7. The ultimate objective of the logistics game is to reposition the following packages to their designated locations: transfer obj72 to apt1; obj62 to apt7; place obj41 at apt5, and obj33 and obj12 both at pos6. Additionally, move obj51 to pos1 and obj53 to apt5, transport obj31 to apt4, obj42 to apt7, and leave obj22 at pos2. Ensure obj61 reaches apt1, obj63 gets to apt3, and position obj71 at pos3. Shift obj11 to apt4, obj23 to pos5, and obj52 at pos4. Then, relocate obj21 to apt4, obj32 to apt2, and obj43 to apt6. Finally, transport obj73 to apt3 and obj13 to apt2.
