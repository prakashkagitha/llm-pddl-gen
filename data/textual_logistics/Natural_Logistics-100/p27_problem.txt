In a logistics scenario, we have several packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. Initially, we have six packages in each city, numbered from obj11 to obj63. These packages are distributed as follows: obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at location pos1 with truck tru1; obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at location pos2 with truck tru2; obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at location pos3 with truck tru3; obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at location pos4 with truck tru4; obj51, obj52, and obj53 are at location pos5 with truck tru5; and obj61, obj62, and obj63 are at location pos6 with truck tru6. Additionally, we have airplanes: apn1 is located at airport apt4, and apn2 is at airport apt2. The cities and their respective locations are: city cit1 has pos1 and apt1, city cit2 has pos2 and apt2, city cit3 has pos3 and apt3, city cit4 has pos4 and apt4, city cit5 has pos5 and apt5, and city cit6 has pos6 and apt6. The goal is to transport certain packages to specific destinations: we want obj53 and obj12 to reach apt5, obj63 to be at apt4, obj13 to move to pos2, obj23 to be at apt4, obj33 at pos4, obj41 at apt3, obj61 at apt4, obj32 at apt3, obj43 at apt3, obj51 at apt1, obj31 at pos5, obj22 at pos3, obj11 at apt4, obj21 at apt3, and obj42 at pos3.
