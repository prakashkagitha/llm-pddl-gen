The logistics game involves several objects and locations. Initially, we have nine packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, and obj33. There are three trucks, named tru1, tru2, and tru3. Additionally, there are three cities: cit1, cit2, and cit3, each containing a set of two specific locations. City cit1 contains pos1 and the airport apt1, city cit2 contains pos2 and the airport apt2, and city cit3 contains pos3 and the airport apt3. Furthermore, there is one airplane, apn1, which is stationed at airport apt1. Initially, truck tru1 is located at pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Truck tru2 is stationed at pos2, where packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are also located. Similarly, truck tru3 is found at pos3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33. The goal of this problem is to rearrange the packages to reach specific destinations: obj11 needs to be at pos3, obj21 should remain at pos2, and obj31 is to be moved to airport apt3. Additionally, obj22 should arrive at pos3, while obj12 stays at pos1. Moreover, obj23 and obj13 are both required to be at airport apt2, and finally, obj32 must reach airport apt1.
