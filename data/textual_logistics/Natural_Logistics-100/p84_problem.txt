In this logistics scenario, we have several objects and locations to consider. Initially, there are six packages named obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. Two trucks, tru1 and tru2, and an airplane, apn1, are available for transportation. We have two cities, cit1 and cit2, each containing specific locations and airports. City cit1 includes a location pos1 and an airport apt1, while city cit2 comprises a location pos2 and an airport apt2. The airplane apn1 is currently located at airport apt2 in city cit2. The truck tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are located at pos1 in city cit1. Meanwhile, truck tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2 in city cit2. Our goal is to transport and arrange the packages as follows: obj23 should be at airport apt1 in city cit1, obj21 should remain at pos2 in city cit2, obj12 should be moved to airport apt2 in city cit2, obj13 needs to be at airport apt1 in city cit1, obj22 should also end up at airport apt1 in city cit1, and finally, obj11 is to be moved to pos2 in city cit2.
