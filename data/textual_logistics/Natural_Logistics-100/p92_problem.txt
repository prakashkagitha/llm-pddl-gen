In the Logistics game, we have several packages, cities, trucks, and airplanes that need to be coordinated. Initially, there are seven packages: package1 through package7. We also have eleven cities: city1 through city11. To transport the packages, we have 52 trucks: truck1 through truck52, and 13 airplanes: plane1 through plane13. Each city contains multiple locations, including airports. The trucks and planes are stationed at specific locations within these cities at the start of the game. For example, plane1 is at airport city6-3, and truck1 is at city5-2. The packages are spread out in various locations as well; for instance, package1, package2, and package3 are all at city7-2, while package7 starts at city4-2. The goal of the game is to transport the packages to their designated destinations. Specifically, package7 needs to be delivered to city5-1, package6 to city5-2, package5 to city2-1, package4 to city5-3, package3 to city5-1, package2 to city5-2, and package1 to city4-1. By using the available trucks and airplanes strategically, each package must reach its destination safely and efficiently.
