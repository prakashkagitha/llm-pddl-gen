In the Logistics game, your goal is to move packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions available to you: You can load a package onto a truck at a given location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if the package and airplane are both at that location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered as no longer being at that location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle and package are at the same location. Unloading relocates the package to the location and detaches it from the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between different locations within the same city, provided the truck is initially at the starting location. After reaching the new location, the truck is considered present there and absent from the initial location. Airplanes are used to transport packages between airports. You can fly an airplane from one airport to another only if the airplane is currently at the departure airport. Upon reaching the destination airport, the airplane is now at that airport and no longer at the original airport.
