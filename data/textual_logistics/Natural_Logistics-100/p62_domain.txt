In the Logistics game, your goal is to move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's what you can do: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both are at the same place. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at the location. To unload a package, make sure both the truck or airplane and the package are at the same location. After unloading, the package is now at the location and no longer inside the vehicle. Driving a truck between two locations is possible if the truck is initially at the starting location and both locations are situated within the same city. After driving, the truck is relocated to the second spot and is no longer at the original location. Meanwhile, flying an airplane can be done between two airports as long as the airplane is currently at the departure airport. Following the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport and not at the departure point anymore.
