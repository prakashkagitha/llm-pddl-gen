In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, or load it onto an airplane at an airport. Conversely, you can unload a package from a truck or from an airplane. To move trucks, you can drive them between two locations within the same city. Airplanes, on the other hand, can be flown between two airports. There are certain rules and restrictions to follow: A package can only be loaded onto a truck or an airplane if both the package and the vehicle are present at the same location. After loading, the package is no longer available at the original location, as it is considered to be inside the vehicle. Unloading is possible only if the vehicle is at a particular location and contains the package; once unloaded, the package now becomes available at that location and is no longer on board. Trucks can only be driven if they are currently at the starting location, and both the starting and destination points must be within the same city. Lastly, airplanes can only take off from their current airport and land at another airport. Once in the air, the airplane will eventually be located at the destination airport, having left the starting point behind.
