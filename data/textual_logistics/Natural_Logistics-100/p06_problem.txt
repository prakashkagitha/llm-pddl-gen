In the Logistics game, we start with the following conditions: We have nine packages labeled from obj11 to obj33. There are three trucks, named tru1, tru2, and tru3, and three cities, cit1, cit2, and cit3. Within these cities, we have specific locations and airports: pos1 and apt1 in city cit1, pos2 and apt2 in city cit2, pos3 and apt3 in city cit3. The three airports, apt1, apt2, and apt3, are located within their respective cities. Additionally, we have an airplane, apn1, stationed at apt3. Initially, tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, are all positioned at pos1. Similarly, tru2, with obj21, obj22, and obj23, are at pos2, while tru3, with obj31, obj32, and obj33, are found at pos3. Our goal is to redistribute the packages such that obj22 is transported to pos3, obj13 to pos2, obj32 to apt2, obj33 remains at apt3, obj23 is moved to apt2, obj31 to apt1, and both obj21 and obj12 reach pos3.
