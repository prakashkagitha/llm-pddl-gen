In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between various locations using different modes of transport. Here are the actions you can take: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, provided both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once a package is loaded, it is no longer considered to be at that location. Similarly, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane, but the vehicle must be at the specified location and the package must be in it. Once unloaded, the package is at that location and no longer within the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city. However, the truck must initially be at the starting location before moving to the next. Once driven, the truck will then be situated at the new location. Airplanes can fly between airports. Before taking off, the airplane has to be present at the departure airport, and once it lands, it will be at the destination airport instead of the original one.
