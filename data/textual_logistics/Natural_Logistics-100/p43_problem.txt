In this Logistics game, we have several packages and vehicles distributed in different cities and locations. Initially, we have the following packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, and obj83. We also have trucks tru1 through tru8 and airplanes apn1 and apn2. The cities involved are cit1 through cit8, with each city containing a position location (pos1 through pos8) and an airport (apt1 through apt8). Airports apt1 through apt8 are scattered across cities cit1 to cit8. Airplanes apn1 and apn2 are initially stationed at airports apt3 and apt4, respectively. For the trucks and packages, tru1 with obj11, obj12, and obj13 begins at pos1; tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 starts at pos2; tru3 with obj31, obj32, and obj33 is at pos3; tru4 with obj41, obj42, and obj43 is at pos4; tru5 with obj51, obj52, and obj53 is at pos5; tru6 with obj61, obj62, and obj63 is at pos6; tru7 with obj71, obj72, and obj73 starts from pos7; and finally, tru8 with obj81, obj82, and obj83 begins at pos8. Each position pos1 to pos8 resides in cities cit1 to cit8, respectively. Our goal in this logistics game is to ensure the packages are at their designated locations: obj41 should be at pos4, obj73 at pos8, obj42 at apt8, obj83 at apt5, obj31 at pos6, obj13 at apt4, obj21 at pos2, obj53 at apt7, obj33 at pos3, obj12 at pos1, obj22 at apt6, obj81 at apt3, obj43 at apt5, obj62 at pos8, obj71 at apt4, obj32 at apt8, obj61 at apt6, obj23 at apt5, obj11 at pos7, obj82 at pos8, obj63 at apt3, obj52 at pos8, and obj72 at apt8.
