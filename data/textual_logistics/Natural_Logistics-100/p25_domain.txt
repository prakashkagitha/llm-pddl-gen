In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Players have a set of actions they can perform: First, to load a package onto a truck at a specified location, ensure that both the package and truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane, as long as both the package and airplane are at the airport. Remember, once a package is loaded onto either a truck or an airplane, it is no longer present at the location. Conversely, unloading a package requires that the vehicle carrying it be at the desired location as well, ensuring that the package has been properly transported. Upon unloading, the package is considered delivered at the location and is no longer with the vehicle. Driving a truck involves moving it between two locations within the same city; ensure the truck starts at the correct location and keep in mind that the destination must be in the same city. After the drive, the truck will only be present at the new location. Lastly, flying an airplane allows you to transport between two airports. The airplane must begin its journey at the initial airport and will travel to a secondary destination airport, no longer remaining at its departure point.
