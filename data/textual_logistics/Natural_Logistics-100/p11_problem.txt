In the Logistics game, we start with several packages, trucks, cities, locations, an airplane, and airports. Initially, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are packages located at position pos1, where the truck tru1 is also located. In another city, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are packages situated at position pos2 along with truck tru2. Moving to a different city, packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at position pos3, where truck tru3 is also stationed. In the last city, packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 reside at position pos4 with truck tru4. Each position is associated with a specific city: pos1 and apt1 are part of cit1, pos2 and apt2 belong to cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, and pos4 and apt4 are in cit4. The airplane, apn1, is currently at airport apt3. Our goal is to relocate these packages as follows: obj33 should be at apt1, obj22 should be at apt2, obj43 should stay at pos4, obj11 should remain at pos1, obj23 is to be moved to pos1, obj31 needs to be repositioned to pos1, obj12 should arrive at apt2, obj13 should be moved to pos4, obj42 is to be delivered to apt2, obj21 must be relocated to pos4, and obj41 should remain at pos4.
