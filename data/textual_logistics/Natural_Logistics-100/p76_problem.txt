In the Logistics game, we start with various packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, locations, and airports. Initially, we have the following packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, obj83, obj91, obj92, obj93, obj101, obj102, obj103, obj111, obj112, obj113, obj121, obj122, obj123, obj131, obj132, obj133. These packages are to be transported using trucks tru1 to tru13 and airplanes apn1 to apn4. The cities involved are cit1 to cit13, each having a position and airport location labeled pos1 to pos13 and apt1 to apt13 respectively. The airports are specifically at the locations: apt1, apt2, apt3, apt4, apt5, apt6, apt7, apt8, apt9, apt10, apt11, apt12, apt13. Currently, airplane apn1 is located at airport apt2, apn2 at apt13, apn3 at apt10, and apn4 at apt1. The trucks and packages are initially located as follows: tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at position pos1; tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 at pos2, and similarly for the other trucks at their respective positions and corresponding packages. Each position and airport is situated within different cities: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, continuing in the same way up to pos13 and apt13 in cit13. The objective is to relocate the packages as follows: move obj41 to apt1, obj43 to apt3, obj11 to apt13, obj21 to apt7, obj113 to pos2, obj32 to apt12, obj31 to apt13, obj123 to pos3, obj13 to pos6, obj122 to pos4, obj83 to pos9, obj82 to pos13, obj103 to apt9, obj81 to pos8, obj92 to apt8, obj12 to apt9, obj101 to pos12, obj132 to apt4, obj73 to apt8, obj63 to apt3, obj91 to apt13, obj133 to apt3, obj23 to pos1, obj42 to apt1, obj52 to pos12, obj131 to apt6, obj22 to apt8, obj112 to pos12, obj93 to apt4, obj62 to apt5, obj53 to pos5, obj61 to pos11, obj72 to apt5, obj33 to apt3, obj71 to pos1, obj111 to pos2, obj121 to pos3, and obj102 to pos10.
