In the Logistics game, the goal is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions available to manage the logistics: Firstly, you can load a package into a truck or onto an airplane at a certain location, but it's essential that both the package and the vehicle are present at that location for the loading to occur. Once a package is loaded, it's no longer considered to be at the original location. Conversely, to unload a package from a truck or airplane, both the vehicle and the package must be at the desired unloading location. After unloading, the package becomes available at the location, and it's not in the vehicle anymore. To move trucks, you can drive them between two points within the same city, provided the truck is starting from the origin location mentioned. Once the truck is driven, it relocates from the first point to the second, indicating it's no longer at the starting point. Lastly, when flying an airplane, you can only do so between airports. The airplane must be at the initial airport to take off, and after the flight, it will be stationed at the destination airport, leaving the starting airport behind.
