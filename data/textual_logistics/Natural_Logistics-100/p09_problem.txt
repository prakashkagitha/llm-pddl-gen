In the Logistics game, we have various objects which include packages, trucks, cities, locations, and an airplane. The initial setup is as follows: There are nine packages named obj11 through obj43, four trucks named tru1 through tru4, four cities named cit1 through cit4, eight locations named pos1 through pos4 and apt1 through apt4, and one airplane named apn1. Each airport, namely apt1 through apt4, serves as a location. Starting positions for these objects are designated: The airplane apn1 is situated at airport apt1. Truck tru1 is located at pos1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Meanwhile, truck tru2 can be found at pos2 alongside packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. Truck tru3, along with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33, is at pos3. Finally, truck tru4 is at pos4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43. Each position is associated with a specific city: pos1 and apt1 are in city cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in city cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in city cit3, and pos4 and apt4 are in city cit4. The objective is to relocate these packages to their respective destinations: obj31 should remain at pos3, obj33 should move to apt3, obj41 should also move to apt3, obj23 should go to pos4, obj11 needs to be at pos3, obj22 should be placed at apt2, obj12 should move to apt1, obj21 needs to be at pos4, obj42 should stay at pos4, and obj32 is to be moved to pos1.
