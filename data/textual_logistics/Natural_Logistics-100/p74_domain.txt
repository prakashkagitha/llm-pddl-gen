In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform several actions to achieve this goal: you can load a package onto a truck if both are at the same location, or onto an airplane when both are at a designated location. Similarly, unloading a package from a truck or airplane is only possible if they are present together at the location. When a package is loaded onto a vehicle, it no longer remains at the location; conversely, unloading the package returns it to the location and removes it from the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city, but only if the truck starts at the first location. Upon moving, the truck relocates to the new destination within that city. Airplanes can only travel between airports, starting and ending at different ones. After a flight, the airplane will be stationed at the destination airport, having left the original one. All actions must adhere to these logical constraints to successfully move the packages to their intended destinations.
