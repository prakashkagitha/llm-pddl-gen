In this logistics scenario, we have several initial conditions: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, and obj73 are all packages. Trucks involved in the delivery include tru1, tru2, tru3, tru4, tru5, tru6, and tru7. Our cities are named cit1, cit2, cit3, cit4, cit5, cit6, and cit7, each containing a location and an airport: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, pos3 and apt3 in cit3, pos4 and apt4 in cit4, pos5 and apt5 in cit5, pos6 and apt6 in cit6, and pos7 and apt7 in cit7. Additionally, we have two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, both of which are initially located at apt3. Starting positions are as follows: tru1, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, tru2, obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2, tru3, obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3, tru4, obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4, tru5, obj51, obj52, and obj53 are at pos5, tru6, obj61, obj62, and obj63 are at pos6, and tru7, obj71, obj72, and obj73 are at pos7. The goal is to deliver the packages to their intended destinations: obj71 should be delivered to apt6, obj53 to pos6, obj72 to pos6, obj12 to pos2, obj11 to apt1, obj52 to pos4, obj41 to apt5, obj31 to apt6, obj62 to apt1, obj42 to apt2, obj13 to pos1, obj22 to pos1, obj43 to apt7, obj73 to apt1, obj33 to pos2, obj61 to pos6, obj21 to pos1, obj23 to apt4, obj32 to apt3, and obj63 to apt3.
