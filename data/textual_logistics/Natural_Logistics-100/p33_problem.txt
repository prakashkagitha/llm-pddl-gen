In the Logistics game, we begin with the following setup: We have seven packages labeled from obj11 to obj73. There are seven trucks named tru1 through tru7, and seven cities, each with a designated position and airport labeled apt1 through apt7. Additionally, two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, are stationed at apt6 and apt5 respectively. The initial locations are as follows: Truck tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1. Truck tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2. Truck tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3. Truck tru4 and packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4. Truck tru5 and packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 are at pos5. Truck tru6 and packages obj61, obj62, and obj63 are at pos6. Truck tru7 and packages obj71, obj72, and obj73 are at pos7. Each position, pos1 to pos7, is located within a respective city, cit1 to cit7, along with corresponding airports, apt1 to apt7. Our objective is to relocate the packages to new destinations as follows: obj21 to apt3, obj62 to apt6, obj43 to apt4, obj42 to pos2, obj73 to apt7, obj63 to apt2, obj13 to pos7, obj11 to pos4, obj61 to apt3, obj52 to pos3, obj41 to pos3, obj12 to pos5, obj51 to apt7, obj72 to pos2, obj31 to apt4, obj32 to pos3, obj33 to apt4, obj22 to pos1, and obj23 to pos2.
