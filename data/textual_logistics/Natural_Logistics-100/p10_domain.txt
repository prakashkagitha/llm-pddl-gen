In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between different locations efficiently. To achieve this, you have a set of actions at your disposal. You can load a package onto a truck at a given location if both the package and truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a specific location, provided both the package and airplane are at that location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it leaves the original location. To unload a package, you need to ensure the truck or airplane is at the desired location and that the package is still inside; upon unloading, the package is placed at the new location. Driving a truck from one place to another within the same city requires the truck to start at the initial location. After driving, the truck will be positioned at the new location, not at the origin. Air travel involves flying an airplane between two airports. The airplane must be at the first airport to begin, and after the flight, it will be stationed at the second airport.
