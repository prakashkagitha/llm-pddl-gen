In the Logistics game, we have the following initial conditions: There are several packages, identified as obj11 through obj93. These packages are distributed across various locations. We also have trucks, labeled tru1 through tru9, and airplanes, named apn1 through apn3, that are stationed around different cities and airports. Specifically, apn1 is located at airport apt1, apn2 at apt6, and apn3 at apt5. Regarding trucks, tru1 can be found at pos1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, tru2 at pos2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23, tru3 at pos3 with obj31, obj32, and obj33, and so on, following a similar pattern for the rest of the trucks. Each position and airport is located in a corresponding city, from cit1 to cit9. Our objective is to move these packages to desired destinations: for instance, obj51 should end up at apt1, obj43 at pos2, obj32 at pos6, and obj71 at apt8. Similarly, obj13 needs to reach apt7, obj52 should go to pos7, obj73 is destined for apt4, and obj61 for pos9. The list continues for other packages with the specified destinations, working towards achieving the logistical goals set in this game scenario.
