We are tasked with a logistics problem involving packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. Initially, we have several packages and vehicles situated at different locations. Packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are initially located at position pos1, alongside truck tru1. At position pos2, truck tru2 is accompanied by packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. Similarly, at pos3, there are truck tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, and obj33, whereas pos4 contains truck tru4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43. At pos5, truck tru5 is located with packages obj51, obj52, and obj53, while at pos6, truck tru6 is placed along with packages obj61, obj62, and obj63. Each position is associated with its respective city: pos1 and airport apt1 are in city cit1, pos2 and airport apt2 are in city cit2, pos3 and airport apt3 are in city cit3, pos4 and airport apt4 are in city cit4, pos5 and airport apt5 are in city cit5, and pos6 and airport apt6 are in city cit6. We also have two airplanes, apn1 located at airport apt1 and apn2 at airport apt6. Our goal is to transport these packages to specific locations: obj51 should move to apt5, obj63 to pos5, obj32 to pos2, obj42 to apt2, obj61 to apt5, obj21 to apt1, obj53 to apt2, obj41 to apt2, obj13 to apt4, obj12 to apt2, obj31 to apt4, obj22 to pos3, obj11 to apt5, obj43 to apt4, obj52 to apt3, obj62 to pos4, and obj23 to pos6.
