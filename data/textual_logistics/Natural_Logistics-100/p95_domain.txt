In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck at its current location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at the location where both are present. Once loaded, the package is no longer at that location. To unload, make sure the truck or airplane is at the desired location and contains the package you want to unload; unloading places the package at the location. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, provided the truck starts at the initial location. Upon driving, the truck ends up at the new location. For air travel, airplanes can fly from one airport to another, but the journey begins with the airplane at the starting airport. After flying, the airplane reaches the second airport. Keep these conditions in mind to ensure smooth transport of your packages.
