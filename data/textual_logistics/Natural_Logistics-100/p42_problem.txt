In the Logistics game, we start with the following setup: We have a series of packages, trucks, airplanes, airports, and cities. The packages are initially placed at various city locations, and airplanes are stationed at specific airports. Here is the initial situation: There are packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 at location pos1, and they are associated with city cit1. Similarly, we have packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 at pos2, in cit2. This pattern continues up to city cit8, where packages obj81, obj82, and obj83 are located at pos8. Trucks tru1 to tru8 correspond with the locations pos1 to pos8 respectively. Airplanes apn1 and apn2 are at airports apt8 and apt7. The locations pos1 to pos8, along with apt1 to apt8, are distributed among the cities cit1 to cit8. Our goal is to transport the packages to their specified destinations as follows: Package obj71 needs to be at airport apt6, obj82 at location pos8, obj52 at airport apt7, obj32 at location pos7, obj33 at airport apt8, obj41 at location pos3, obj61 at location pos2, obj53 at airport apt7, obj63 at airport apt5, obj83 at location pos3, obj31 at airport apt5, obj43 at airport apt2, obj11 at airport apt5, obj72 at airport apt2, obj62 at airport apt6, obj22 at location pos2, obj51 at airport apt4, obj23 at location pos4, obj12 at airport apt7, obj13 at airport apt1, obj21 at airport apt4, obj81 at airport apt2, and obj73 at location pos2. The objective is to move all packages to their respective destinations efficiently.
