In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using available vehicles. You have a set of actions you can perform to achieve this goal: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if the package and airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered to be with the vehicle and no longer at the initial location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, the vehicle must be at a specific location with the package inside. Upon unloading, the package becomes available at the location and is no longer inside the vehicle. Additionally, trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck starts at the first location. Once driven, the truck moves to the new location. Airplanes can fly between different airports, but they must start from their current airport. After a flight, the airplane and any loaded packages will be located at the destination airport. All these actions are subject to specific conditions to ensure the smooth transition of packages between locations.
