In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at the original location. Furthermore, you can unload a package from a truck or airplane only if the vehicle is at the designated location and the package is onboard. After unloading, the package is at the new location and no longer inside the truck or airplane. You can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck begins at the starting location. Once you drive the truck, it relocates to the new location and is no longer present at the initial spot. Flying an airplane is possible between two airports. The airplane must be at the departure airport initially, and after flying, it reaches the destination airport. These actions help you navigate and move packages efficiently within the gameplay, each with its specific conditions and consequences.
