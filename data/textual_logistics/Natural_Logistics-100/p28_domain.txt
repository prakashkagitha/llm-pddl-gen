In the Logistics game, you are tasked with transporting packages between various locations. To achieve this, you can take the following actions: You can load a package onto a truck or airplane, but this is only possible if both the package and the truck or airplane are present at the same location. Once the package is loaded, it is considered to have left the original location. Conversely, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane only if the vehicle is currently at the location, and the package is on board. After unloading, the package is at the location and no longer on the vehicle. When it comes to moving vehicles, you can drive a truck from one location to another, provided both are within the same city and the truck is at the starting location. After the drive, the truck moves to the destination location. For air transport, you can fly an airplane from one airport to another, with the condition that the airplane is located at the departure airport initially. After the flight, the airplane arrives at the destination airport.
