In the Logistics game, we begin with several packages and vehicles initially positioned across multiple locations. Packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 start at position pos1 with truck tru1, which is located in city cit1. Similarly, in city cit2, packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at position pos2 with truck tru2. Each city from cit1 to cit9 has a position and an airport location (apt1 to apt9) with corresponding vehicles and packages. Airplanes apn1, apn2, and apn3 are stationed at airports apt8, apt5, and apt9 respectively. Our goal in this game is to achieve a specific arrangement of these packages across locations: Package obj82 should be at pos7, obj51 should remain at pos5, obj41 should move to apt1, and obj91 to apt2. Meanwhile, obj73 is to be positioned at pos8, obj33 also at pos8, obj21 at apt5, obj83 at pos3, and obj53 needs to transition to pos2. We also aim to place obj32 at pos5, obj52 at apt1, obj31 at pos9, and obj22 at apt6. Additionally, obj11 must move to pos4, obj72 to pos1, obj43 to pos1, obj23 to apt3, and obj61 to pos9. Furthermore, obj12 should go to pos6, obj62 to pos1, obj63 to apt6, obj71 to apt2, and obj42 at pos8. Finally, obj13 should be moved to apt1, and obj81 should arrive at apt5.
