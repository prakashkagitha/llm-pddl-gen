In the Logistics game, the initial setup is as follows: We have several packages labeled as obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, and obj33. Additionally, there are three trucks named tru1, tru2, and tru3; three cities labeled cit1, cit2, and cit3; and six locations known as pos1, apt1, pos2, apt2, pos3, and apt3. Among these locations, apt1, apt2, and apt3 are classified as airports. We also have an airplane, apn1, which is currently located at airport apt2. In this setup, truck tru1 is located at pos1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Truck tru2 is stationed at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. Meanwhile, truck tru3 is at pos3, accompanied by obj31, obj32, and obj33. The cities contain specific locations as follows: pos1 and apt1 are within cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, and pos3 and apt3 are situated in cit3. The goal is to achieve the following condition: obj23 should be at pos3, obj32 at pos1, obj22 at pos1, obj31 at apt3, obj11 remaining at pos1, obj33 at pos3, obj13 at apt3, obj12 remaining at pos1, and obj21 at apt1.
