In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions at your disposal to achieve this objective. You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, but both the package and the vehicle must be at the same location for this to happen. Once the package is loaded, it is no longer considered to be at that location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the desired location, and the package should be inside the vehicle. After unloading, the package will reside at the location and will no longer be inside the vehicle. Driving a truck from one location to another is possible only if the truck is at the starting location and both locations lie within the same city. After the truck is driven, it will move to the destination location. Airplanes are used to transport packages between airports. You can fly an airplane from one airport to another, but the airplane must be at the starting airport initially. Once the flight is completed, the airplane transitions to the destination airport and leaves the starting airport behind.
