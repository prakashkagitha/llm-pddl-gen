In the Logistics game, we start with several objects and their initial setups. We have packages labeled from obj11 to obj83, trucks from tru1 to tru8, cities from cit1 to cit8, and locations like pos1, apt1, etc. Airports include apt1 through apt8, and there are two airplanes, apn1 and apn2. The airplane apn1 begins at airport apt5, while apn2 starts at airport apt3. Truck tru1 is stationed at location pos1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Similarly, tru2 is at pos2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23. This pattern continues with each truck stationed at its corresponding position, carrying the packages obj31 to obj83. Each location, such as pos1 and apt1, belongs to a respective city, starting from cit1 through to cit8. The objective is to move the packages to specific destinations. For example, obj12 needs to arrive at apt2, while obj71 should be relocated to pos3. Package obj31 targets pos8, and obj11 has to reach apt8. The final destinations for each package have been predefined, like obj41 going to apt6, and so on. Our task is to employ the available resources, such as the trucks and airplanes, to achieve these delivery goals.
