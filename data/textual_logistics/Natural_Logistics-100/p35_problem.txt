In the Logistics game, the initial setup includes several objects and their locations. There are seven packages to manage: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, and obj73. Additionally, we have seven trucks named tru1 through tru7 and two airplanes, apn1 and apn2. We also have seven cities, designated as cit1 to cit7, and each city contains two locations: a position and an airport. The positions are labeled pos1 through pos7, and the airports are labeled apt1 through apt7, with each airport designated as an airport in the respective city.

The airplanes and trucks are initially placed as follows: truck tru1 starts at pos1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13; truck tru2 is at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23; truck tru3 is at pos3 with obj31, obj32, and obj33; truck tru4 is at pos4 with obj41, obj42, and obj43; truck tru5 is at pos5 with obj51, obj52, and obj53; truck tru6 is at pos6 with obj61, obj62, and obj63; truck tru7 is at pos7 with obj71, obj72, and obj73. Meanwhile, airplane apn1 is situated at airport apt5, and airplane apn2 is at airport apt3.

Each position and airport is situated in a designated city. The specific placements are as follows: pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 are in cit2, pos3 and apt3 are in cit3, pos4 and apt4 are in cit4, pos5 and apt5 are in cit5, pos6 and apt6 are in cit6, and pos7 and apt7 are in cit7.

The goal of the game is to move the packages according to the following targets: obj11 should be at apt1, obj22 should arrive at pos3, obj51 should move to apt5, obj33 should stay at pos3, obj42 should end up at apt6, obj52 needs to be at apt5, obj32 should reach pos1, obj71 should be transported to pos1, obj72 should arrive at apt2, obj61 should be at apt7, obj12 should move to pos7, obj41 needs to be at apt4, obj63 should be at pos1, obj73 needs to be at pos2, obj31 should be transported to pos7, obj62 should arrive at apt2, obj13 should remain at pos1, and both obj23 and obj21 should be delivered to apt2.
