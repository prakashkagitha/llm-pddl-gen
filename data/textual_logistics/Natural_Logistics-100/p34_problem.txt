In this logistics scenario, we have several packages and vehicles to manage. Initially, we have six packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. There are two trucks, tru1 and tru2, and an airplane, apn1. The locations involved are two cities, cit1 and cit2, with each city having specific locations: pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2. Each city has an airport, with apt1 being in cit1 and apt2 in cit2. The airplane, apn1, is currently stationed at apt1. The truck tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, are at pos1, while the truck tru2, with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23, is at pos2. Our goal is to reorganize the logistics so that package obj23 is delivered to apt2, package obj22 reaches apt1, package obj13 is moved to apt2, and packages obj12 and obj11 are relocated to pos2.
