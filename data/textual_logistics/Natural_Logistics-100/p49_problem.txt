In the logistics game, we have a series of packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations with specific initial conditions and a particular goal. Initially, there are 27 packages labeled obj11 to obj93. There are 9 trucks labeled tru1 to tru9, 9 cities labeled cit1 to cit9, and locations within these cities labeled pos1 to pos9 and airports apt1 to apt9. The airports are located in respective cities, for example, apt1 and pos1 are in cit1. Additionally, there are 3 airplanes: apn1 located at apt8, apn2 at apt6, and apn3 at apt4. Trucks and packages are positioned as follows: tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, obj13 are at pos1; tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, obj23 are at pos2; tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, obj33 are at pos3, and so on up to tru9 and packages obj91, obj92, obj93 at pos9. The goal is to move these packages so that obj43 ends up at pos4, obj71 at pos7, obj52 and obj92 at pos2, obj83 at pos1, obj62 at pos4, obj73 at apt3, obj61 and obj11 at apt6, obj22 at apt6, obj23 at apt7, obj72 at pos7, obj31 at apt2, obj21 at pos3, obj81 at apt5, obj32 at apt7, obj33 at pos5, obj13 at pos5, obj41 at apt8, obj12 at pos7, obj42 at apt1, obj51 at pos1, obj53 at apt7, obj63 and obj93 at apt2, and obj82 at pos5.
