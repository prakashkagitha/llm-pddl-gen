In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between various locations. To achieve this, you have several actions at your disposal: You can load a package onto a truck if the truck and the package are both at the same location. Similarly, loading a package onto an airplane requires that both the package and the airplane are present at the location. After successfully loading a package onto a truck or an airplane, the package will no longer be available at the original location. To unload a package, ensure that the vehicle (truck or airplane) is at the specified location and that the package is inside it. Once unloaded, the package will be at the location and not inside the vehicle anymore. Trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck is initially present at the starting location of the route. After driving the truck, its new position will be the destination, and it will no longer be at the origin. Similarly, airplanes can be flown between airports. The airplane should start off at the initial airport before flying, and after the flight, it will reside at the destination airport, being no longer at the origin airport. These rules govern the movement and handling of packages in the Logistics game, ensuring efficient and correct transportation between different points within cities and across airports.
