In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages from one location to another using trucks and airplanes. Here are the possible actions and their corresponding rules: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present at that location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto the truck or airplane, it will no longer be considered as being at the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, both the vehicle and the package must be present at the unloading location. After unloading, the package will be at the location and no longer in the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, provided the truck is initially at the starting location. After the drive, the truck will be at the destination location and not at the starting location. Airplanes can only fly between airports. The airplane must be at the departure airport at the beginning of the flight. After flying, the airplane will arrive at the destination airport and will no longer be at the departure airport.
