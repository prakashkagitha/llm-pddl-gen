In the Logistics game, we start with the following scenario: There are six packages labeled obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. We have two trucks, tru1 and tru2, and two cities identified as cit1 and cit2. Within these cities, there are several locations: pos1 and apt1 in city cit1, and pos2 and apt2 in city cit2. Both apt1 and apt2 are designated as airports. Additionally, there is one airplane, apn1, currently located at airport apt1. Truck tru1 is parked at location pos1, alongside packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Meanwhile, truck tru2 is stationed at location pos2, where packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are situated. The goal is to maneuver the packages so that obj23 and obj11 are both located at pos1, packages obj22 and obj21 are relocated to apt2, and obj12 is moved to apt1.
