In the Logistics game, we start with several packages and vehicles distributed across different cities and locations. There are packages labeled from obj11 to obj113, trucks numbered tru1 to tru11, cities named cit1 to cit11, locations named pos1 to pos11 and apt1 to apt11. Each airport is considered as a special location. Additionally, there are three airplanes: apn1, apn2, and apn3, initially stationed at airports apt4, apt10, and apt1, respectively. The current positions of trucks and corresponding packages are as follows: tru1 and obj11, obj12, obj13 are at pos1; tru2 and obj21, obj22, obj23 are at pos2; tru3 and obj31, obj32, obj33 are at pos3; and so on until tru11, which along with obj111, obj112, obj113, is at pos11. Each city contains one location and one airport. For instance, pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and this pattern continues similarly. The goal of the game is to rearrange the packages to meet specific destination criteria. Packages obj33, obj71, obj83, obj23, and several others need to be relocated to specified locations like apt1, apt10, pos3, apt3, and so forth. The task is to efficiently move the packages to their respective target destinations.
