In the Logistics game, you are tasked with moving packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. To do this, you can perform several actions. You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, provided that both the package and the vehicle are present there. When a package is loaded onto a truck or an airplane, it is considered to be inside the vehicle and no longer at the initial location. Conversely, to unload a package from a truck or an airplane, the vehicle must be at the designated location, and the package must already be inside the vehicle. Unloading a package places it at the location and removes it from the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between different locations within the same city, but only if the truck is currently at the starting location. Once driven, the truck will be at the destination and no longer at the start. Airplanes can be flown between airports, as long as the airplane starts at the first airport. After flying, the airplane will be situated at the new airport, leaving the original one. These actions allow you to strategically manage the transportation of packages across various locations.
