In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck at a particular location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, loading a package onto an airplane requires both the package and the airplane to be at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it leaves its original location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the same location where you want to unload, and the package should be inside the vehicle. When you unload, the package arrives at the new location and exits the vehicle. If you want to drive a truck from one location to another within a city, the truck needs to begin its journey at the starting point, and both locations must be within the city boundaries. After driving, the truck will find itself at the destination, leaving the starting point behind. As for flying, an airplane can travel between two airports, but it must be ready for takeoff from the initial airport. After the flight, the airplane lands at the destination airport, departing from the origin airport in the process.
