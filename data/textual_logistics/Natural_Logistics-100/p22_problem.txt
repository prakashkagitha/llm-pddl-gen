In the Logistics game, we have the following initial setup: There are six packages, named package1 through package6, and each is located in different places across six cities, labeled city1 through city6. There are also six trucks, one for each city, named truck1 through truck6, and two airplanes, plane1 and plane2. Each city has a distinct location labeled city]-1 and an airport labeled city]-2 (for example, city1-1 and city1-2 for city1). The trucks are initially located at their corresponding city]-1 locations, and both airplanes are initially stationed at city4-2. Of the packages, package6 is at city3-1, package5 is at city4-2, package4 and package3 are both at city1-1, package2 is at city1-2, and package1 is at city2-1. Our objective is to rearrange the locations of the packages so that package6 reaches city1-2, package5 arrives at city6-2, package4 is relocated to city3-2, package3 finds its way to city6-1, package2 is moved to city6-2, and package1 remains at city2-1.
