In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations. To accomplish this, the following actions can be performed: Packages can be loaded onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, provided both the package and the vehicle are at that location. This can be done using the actions: 'load-truck package onto truck at location' and 'load-airplane package onto airplane at location'. Once a package is loaded, it is considered to be inside the truck or airplane and not at the original location anymore. Correspondingly, a package can be unloaded from a truck or an airplane at a location, assuming the vehicle and package are present at that location. This is done via the actions: 'unload-truck package from truck at location' and 'unload-airplane package from airplane at location'. After unloading, the package is placed at the location and no longer in the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between different locations within the same city using the action: 'drive-truck from one location to another within a city', but only if the truck is stationed at the starting location. Similarly, airplanes can be flown from one airport to another using the action: 'fly-airplane from one airport to another', provided the airplane is present at the first airport. After flying, the airplane is considered to have arrived at the destination airport.
