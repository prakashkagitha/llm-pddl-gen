In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You have various actions available to achieve this goal: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, provided that both the package and the vehicle are present at that location. Once a package is loaded into the truck or airplane, it is no longer considered to be at that location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the intended location, and the package must be inside the vehicle. Upon unloading, the package is placed at the location and removed from the vehicle. When it comes to moving the vehicles themselves, trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city. To do this, the truck must be present at the start location. Once driven, the truck relocates to the destination and is no longer at the starting point. Airplanes, on the other hand, can travel between airports. To fly an airplane, it must be located at the first airport. Following the flight, the airplane will then be situated at the destination airport and not at the point of departure.
