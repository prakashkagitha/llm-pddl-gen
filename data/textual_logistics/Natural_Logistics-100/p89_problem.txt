In the Logistics game, the initial setup is as follows: We have several packages and vehicles spread across different cities and locations. Packages 23 through 1 are designated as packages. Cities 29 through 1 are identified as cities, and each city has a set of locations. A fleet of trucks, labeled as truck 29 through truck 1, and airplanes, labeled as plane 9 through plane 1, are part of the logistics network. Each city has specific locations, including some designated as airports. Currently, the planes and trucks are parked at specific city locations, and packages are scattered across different places. For example, package 23 is currently located at city 26, location 2, while package 22 is at city 1, location 1. The goal is to relocate the packages to new destinations: package 23 should be at city 7-4, package 22 at city 11-3, package 21 at city 16-4, package 20 at city 4-4, package 19 at city 21-2, package 18 at city 22-1, package 17 at city 18-3, and package 16 at city 14-3. Your task is to efficiently coordinate the movement of vehicles and packages to achieve this desired outcome.
