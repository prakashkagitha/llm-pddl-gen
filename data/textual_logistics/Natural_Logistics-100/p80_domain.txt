In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, a package can be loaded onto an airplane only if both are present at the same location. When you load a package onto a truck or airplane, the package is considered to be no longer at the location. The package must be unloaded only from a truck or airplane when they are at the intended location, making the package a part of that location again and not in the vehicle. Driving a truck between two locations within the same city is possible if the truck is currently at the starting location. Once the truck is driven, it relocates to the destination within the city. Flying an airplane between two airports is allowed if the airplane is stationed at the first airport initially. The airplane relocates to the second airport after the flight. Each of these actions is guided by specific conditions ensuring the logical flow of operations in the logistics process.
