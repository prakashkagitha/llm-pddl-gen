In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can perform several actions to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if the package and the truck are both present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or an airplane, it is no longer considered to be at the original location. Conversely, to unload a package from a truck or an airplane, both the vehicle (truck or airplane) and package must be at the same location, ensuring that the package comes out at the designated location and is no longer in the vehicle. For moving vehicles: a truck can be driven from one location to another within the same city, but only if it's currently at the starting location. The destination also has to be within the same city for the move to be valid; after the drive, the truck will be at the new location and no longer at the previous one. An airplane can fly between two airports if it starts at the first airport. Once the flight is complete, the airplane is stationed at the second airport, leaving the first behind. These rules and restrictions guide how you can strategically maneuver packages and vehicles to succeed in the Logistics game.
