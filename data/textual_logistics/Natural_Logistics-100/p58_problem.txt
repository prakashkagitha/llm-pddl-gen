Initially, we have several packages and vehicles in a logistics game setting. There are packages labeled from obj11 to obj103 and trucks labeled from tru1 to tru10. Additionally, there are airplanes labeled apn1 to apn3, and cities labeled cit1 to cit10, each with a designated location: pos1 to pos10 and airports apt1 to apt10. All airports are indeed airports, with example designations such as apt1 being an airport in cit1. Airplanes are initially located as follows: apn1 at apt8, apn2 at apt7, and apn3 at apt9. Each truck is starting at a position corresponding to the number, for instance, tru1 is at pos1, and each position contains packages with the same initial numbers as trucks and positions. For instance, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are initially at pos1 with tru1. Moreover, specific locations correspond to their respective cities; for example, pos1 and apt1 are located within cit1. Our goal is to rearrange these packages to new designated locations: obj51 should be moved to pos2, obj43 to pos10, obj82 to apt6, obj33 should remain at pos3, and so forth. This involves packages being transported across different cities and locations, such as obj12 needing to move to pos7 and obj93 ending up at apt7. The challenge is to achieve all the required goals involving both trucks and airplanes operating within this multi-city, multi-location setup.
