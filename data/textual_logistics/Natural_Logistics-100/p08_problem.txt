We are playing the Logistics game where we have several packages and vehicles located in different cities. Initially, we have nine packages: obj11, obj12, and obj13, all located at pos1 in city cit1; obj21, obj22, and obj23 at pos2 in city cit2; and obj31, obj32, and obj33 at pos3 in city cit3. We also have three trucks: tru1 at pos1, tru2 at pos2, and tru3 at pos3. There are three airports: apt1 in city cit1, apt2 in city cit2, and apt3 in city cit3, with one airplane, apn1, currently stationed at apt1. Our goal is to relocate the packages as follows: move obj11 to apt2, obj31 to pos3, obj13 to pos3, obj23 to apt3, obj33 to apt3, obj22 to remain at pos2, obj32 to apt3, obj21 to stay at pos2, and obj12 to pos3.
