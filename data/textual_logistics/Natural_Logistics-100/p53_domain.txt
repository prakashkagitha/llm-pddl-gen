In the Logistics game, your objective is to transfer packages between different locations. You have a set of actions you can perform to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane if both the package and the transport vehicle are present at the same location. After loading the package onto the vehicle, the package is considered to have left that location. You can unload a package from a truck or an airplane only if the vehicle and package are both at the designated location. Once unloaded, the package is now at the location and no longer aboard the vehicle. Driving a truck from one location to another within the same city is possible if the truck starts at the initial location. After driving, the truck is at the new location and left the original one. For air travel, you can fly an airplane between two airports, only if the airplane is at the first airport. Once the flight is complete, the airplane is then at the second airport and has departed the first.
