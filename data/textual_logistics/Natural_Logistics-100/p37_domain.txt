In the Logistics game, your task is to transfer packages between various locations. You have several actions at your disposal: A package can be loaded onto a truck at a specific location as long as both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it leaves the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, the vehicle and the package must both be present at the current location. Once a package is unloaded, it becomes part of that location's inventory, leaving the truck or airplane. Driving a truck requires that the truck is present at the initial location, and both locations involved are within the same city. After driving the truck, it moves to the new location and leaves the previous one. For flying, an airplane can move between two airports only if it's currently at the starting airport. After the airplane flies, it transitions to the destination airport, vacating the starting point.
