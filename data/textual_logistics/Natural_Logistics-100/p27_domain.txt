In the Logistics game, your goal is to move packages between various locations. You have several actions available to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane when both the package and the airplane are at the same site. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered to be inside the vehicle and no longer at the original location. Conversely, you can unload a package from a truck or airplane at a specific location if the vehicle is present, and the package is inside it. After unloading, the package is at the location, and no longer inside the vehicle. For ground transportation, you can drive a truck between two locations within the same city, provided the truck is at the starting location. Once you drive, the truck is now at the destination location and no longer at the starting point. For air travel, you can fly an airplane between two airports. The airplane must start at the first airport to fly. After the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport, leaving the starting point. These actions and rules help you successfully transport packages across different locations and logistics scenarios.
