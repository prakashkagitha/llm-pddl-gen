In the Logistics game, I have a series of packages and transportation vehicles distributed across several cities and locations. Initially, we have packages labeled obj11 through obj113, a total of 33 packages. There are also 11 trucks labeled from tru1 to tru11, each initially located at different positions, pos1 through pos11, across the cities cit1 to cit11. Each city has an airport location, apt1 through apt11, and contains one airplane: apn1 is at apt3, apn2 is at apt2, and apn3 is at apt11. 

 The initial setup is as follows: 
 - In city cit1, located at pos1, we have truck tru1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. 
 - In city cit2, at pos2, truck tru2 holds packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. 
 - Similarly, the pattern continues across the cities up to city cit11 where truck tru11 is at pos11 with packages obj111, obj112, and obj113. Each city's airport is nearby, but initially, our focus is on the packages at different positions. 

 My objective is to rearrange these packages to new specified destinations: 
 - I aim to have obj23 moved to pos4, obj92 to apt2, and obj101 to pos6. 
 - I would like obj21 to be at pos7, obj31 at apt7, and obj51 relocated to pos1. 
 - Further movements include obj113 to apt5, obj61 to pos7, and obj112 to pos2. 
 - Also obj62 should reach apt9, obj43 to apt4, and obj103 to pos6. 
 - As for obj11, it should be at apt6, while obj81 and obj93 should both be placed at apt11. 
 - Obj53 needs to go to apt3, obj32 to apt1, and obj102 should go to apt6. 
 - Obj41 must be at apt4, while obj83 should remain at pos3 along with obj33. 
 - Other specific destinations include obj22 at pos7, obj12 at apt9, obj73 at pos2, and obj52 at apt8. 
 - Obj63 should arrive at apt3, obj91 at apt11, and obj82 should stay at apt4. 
 - In addition, obj71 must reach pos1, obj13 should be positioned at pos8, and obj72 along with obj111 should respectively be moved to pos4 and apt9. 
 - Finally, obj42 needs to be transferred to pos2. 

 Organizing this logistical network requires careful planning to achieve the desired package arrangements across these different locations.
