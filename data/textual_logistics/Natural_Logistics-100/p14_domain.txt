In the Logistics game, your goal is to move packages between different locations efficiently. To achieve this, you have several actions at your disposal: You can load a package onto a truck or airplane if both the package and the vehicle are present at the same location. Once you've loaded a package onto the truck or airplane, it will no longer be at the original location. To unload a package from either a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle is at the designated location and that the package is inside. Upon unloading, the package will be at the new location and no longer in the truck or airplane. When you need to transport packages within a city, you can drive a truck from one location to another, provided the truck is already at the starting location and both locations are within the same city. After driving, the truck will be at the new location and left the previous one. For intercity transportation, airplanes come into play. You can fly an airplane between two airports, ensuring the airplane is initially at the first airport. Once the flight is completed, the airplane resides at the destination airport instead of the origin.
