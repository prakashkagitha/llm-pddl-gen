In the Logistics game, we start with five packages and ten cities. Package5, package4, package3, package2, and package1 each need to be delivered to specific locations. The game includes a fleet of ten trucks and four airplanes. Each city has a designated city location and an airport. The initial setup is as follows: In city10, we have locations city10-1 and city10-2, with city10-2 being the airport. Similarly, for each of the other cities from city1 to city9, there are corresponding locations and airports. The planes start at specific airports: plane4 and plane2 are at city3-2, plane3 is at city7-2, and plane1 is at city6-2. Each truck begins at a separate city location: truck10 at city10-1, truck9 at city9-1, and so on, down to truck1 at city1-1. The packages are initially located as follows: package5 is at city1-2, package4 at city7-2, package3 at city3-2, package2 at city10-1, and package1 at city2-2. The objective is to deliver these packages to their goal locations: package5 to city4-2, package4 to city6-1, package3 to city1-1, package2 to city9-2, and package1 to city3-1.
