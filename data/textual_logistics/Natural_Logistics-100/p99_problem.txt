In the Logistics game, we have the following initial setup: There are five packages named package1 to package5 and eight cities named city1 to city8. Each city has specific locations. For instance, city1 has locations city1-1, city1-2, and an airport called city1-3; similarly, each of the other cities has locations and an airport respectively. We also have fifteen trucks, named truck1 to truck15, and one airplane named plane1. The plane is currently located at the airport city3-3. Truck15 is stationed at city8-2, truck14 at city7-2, truck13 at city6-1, and so on, with each truck initially located at different city locations. Regarding the packages, package5 starts at city3-2, package4 is at city5-1, package3 is at city1-1, package2 is at city5-2, and package1 begins at city2-1. The objective is to deliver these packages to their new destinations: package5 should be at city6-3, package4 at city5-3, package3 should move to city8-3, package2 should reach city4-3, and package1 should be delivered to city6-3. The challenge is to achieve this using the available trucks and airplane effectively.
