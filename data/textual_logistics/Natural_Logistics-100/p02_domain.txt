In the Logistics game, you are tasked with efficiently moving packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's what you can do: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, but only if both the package and the vehicle are at the same location. Once loaded, the package is no longer considered to be at that location. Unloading is only allowed if both the package and the vehicle are present at the location. Upon unloading, the package is then placed at that location and is no longer in the vehicle. Trucks can be driven between locations within the same city, provided the truck starts at the first location. Post-driving, the truck will be situated at the second location. For air travel, airplanes are restricted to flying between airports. An airplane can only take off if it is currently at the airport of departure, and after flying, it will be located at the destination airport.
