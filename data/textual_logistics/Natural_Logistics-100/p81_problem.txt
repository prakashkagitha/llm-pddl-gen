We have a challenging logistics problem involving the transportation of packages across multiple cities using different modes of transportation such as trucks and airplanes. The initial state consists of numerous packages and vehicles dispersed across various locations in multiple cities. Specifically, we have packages named obj11 through obj143, and our fleet includes trucks tru1 to tru14, and airplanes apn1 to apn4. Our cities, numbered cit1 to cit14, contain specific positions and airports. Trucks are stationed at positions such as pos1 in cit1 and pos2 in cit2, corresponding to the packages they need to load initially. Airplanes, on the other hand, start at specific airports such as apn1 at apt3 in cit3 and apn2 at apt4 in cit4. Our goal is to strategically transport each package to its desired location across the cities, employing the right combinations of trucks and airplanes. The main objectives include moving obj52 to pos7, obj142 to apt4, and obj42 to pos10 among others. Each package's final destination is clearly defined, such as obj11 going to apt5 and obj123 to pos7. The challenge lies in optimizing the route and mode of transportation for each package so that they reach their target locations efficiently.
