In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location if both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a specific location if both the package and the airplane are there. After loading a package onto a truck or airplane, it is considered to be within that vehicle and no longer at its original location. To remove a package, you can unload it from a truck or airplane, but only if both the vehicle and the package are at the required location. Once you unload the package, it becomes available at the location where the unloading occurred, and it is no longer inside the vehicle. Trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, but only if the truck is currently at the starting location. Upon completing the drive, the truck will be at the destination location. Airplanes can fly between two airports as long as the airplane is initially at the departure airport. Once the airplane flies, it will be at the arrival airport and no longer at the departure airport.
