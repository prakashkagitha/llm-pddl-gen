In the Logistics game, the initial scenario is as follows: We have seven packages labeled as package1 through package7. Three cities are involved, named city1, city2, and city3. Each city has distinct locations, with city1 having locations city1-1 and city1-2, city2 having city2-1 and city2-2, and city3 containing city3-1 and city3-2. There are several vehicles available: nine trucks (truck1 through truck9) and one airplane (plane1). Each vehicle starts at a specific location: plane1 is at the airport city1-2, truck1 is at city2-2, truck2 and truck3 are at city1-2, truck4, truck5, and truck9 are at city3-1, truck6 and truck7 are at city1-2 and city1-1 respectively, and truck8 is at city2-1. Packages are also initially positioned: package1 and package2 are at city1-2, package3 and package7 are at city2-1, package4 is at city3-1, and package5 and package6 start at city2-2. To win the game, the goal is to move the packages to specific locations: package7 needs to reach city2-2, package6 and package5 should be relocated to city3-2, package4 is destined for city2-2, package3 should arrive at city3-2, package2 must be delivered to city1-1, and package1 needs to be moved to city2-1.
