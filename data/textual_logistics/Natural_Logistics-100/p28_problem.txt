In the Logistics game, the initial setup consists of several packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. There are packages labeled obj11 through obj63 and trucks labeled tru1 through tru6. Each city, cit1 through cit6, has a position (pos1 through pos6) and an airport (apt1 through apt6). There are also two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, initially located at airports apt6 and apt5, respectively. At the start, truck tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, is at location pos1, which is situated in city cit1. Similarly, tru2 with obj21, obj22, and obj23 is at pos2 in cit2, tru3 with obj31, obj32, and obj33 is at pos3 in cit3, tru4 with obj41, obj42, and obj43 is at pos4 in cit4, tru5 with obj51, obj52, and obj53 is at pos5 in cit5, and tru6 with obj61, obj62, and obj63 is at pos6 in cit6. The goal is to transport these packages to specific destinations: obj11 needs to be moved to pos5, obj31 to apt2, obj52 to apt4, obj13 to apt1, obj32 to apt6, obj53 to apt3, obj22 to pos5, obj63 to apt5, obj12 to apt4, obj62 to apt6, obj43 to apt6, obj51 to apt6, obj33 to apt2, obj61 to apt5, obj42 to pos2, and obj21 to apt4.
