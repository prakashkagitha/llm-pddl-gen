In the Logistics game, the objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions at your disposal to achieve this goal: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, but only if the package and the vehicle are present at the same location. Once loaded, the package is considered to be inside the vehicle and no longer at the initial location. Similarly, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane, provided the vehicle is at the location and the package is on board. After unloading, the package is now at the location and no longer inside the vehicle. When it comes to moving vehicles, trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city, but only if the truck is initially at the starting location. Once the truck is driven, it moves from the start location to the destination within the city. Airplanes can be flown between airports; however, this is possible only if the airplane is currently at the departure airport. After the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport.
