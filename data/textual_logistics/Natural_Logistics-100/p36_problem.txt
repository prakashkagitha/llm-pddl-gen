In the Logistics game, our initial setup involves several packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. We have packages labeled from obj11 to obj73, trucks labeled tru1 to tru7, and airplanes labeled apn1 and apn2. Our cities are identified as cit1 to cit7, and within each city, there are a couple of locations, including a position and an airport, such as pos1 and apt1 in cit1. The airplane apn1 is currently located at airport apt7, while apn2 is at apt4. Each truck starts from its respective position: tru1 at pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, tru2 at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23, and so on, up to tru7 at pos7 with packages obj71, obj72, and obj73. Each position and airport is within a specified city. Our goal is to reposition certain packages to new locations: move obj32 to apt2, obj31 to pos7, obj11 to apt7, obj53 to pos3, obj43 to apt3, obj62 to pos7, obj23 to pos3, obj42 to pos7, obj71 to pos6, obj13 to pos6, obj52 to pos7, obj72 to apt4, obj73 to pos2, obj33 to pos2, obj63 to apt7, obj51 to pos5, obj22 to pos2, obj41 to apt2, obj61 to pos6, and obj21 to apt4.
