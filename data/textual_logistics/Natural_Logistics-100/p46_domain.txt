The Logistics game involves moving packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions available to manage this task effectively. First, you can load a package onto a truck or an airplane, but ensure that both the package and the vehicle are present at the same location beforehand. Once a package is loaded onto the vehicle, it will no longer be considered as being at the original location. When you need to unload the package from a truck or an airplane, it is crucial that the vehicle is at a designated location and the package must be inside the vehicle. Post unloading, the package will now be at the new location and not in the vehicle anymore. Driving a truck between two locations requires that the truck is initially at the starting location, and both locations should be within the same city. Upon driving, the truck will move to the new location and will no longer be available at the original one. Airplane travel involves flying between two airports, with the condition that the airplane begins its journey at the first airport. After the flight, the airplane will reside at the destination airport and not at the starting point anymore.
