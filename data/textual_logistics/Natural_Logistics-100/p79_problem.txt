In the Logistics game, several packages, trucks, airplanes, and locations are involved. Initially, we have packages labeled from obj11 to obj133, trucks numbered from tru1 to tru13, and airplanes identified as apn1 to apn4. The game features cities, each containing a distinct position and airport. The airplanes are positioned as follows: apn1 is at the airport apt7, apn2 at airport apt3, apn3 at airport apt12, and apn4 at airport apt9. Each truck starts with three packages at a specific position in different cities: tru1 with obj11, obj12, obj13 at pos1; tru2 with obj21, obj22, obj23 at pos2, and so on, continuing in sequential order up to tru13 with obj131, obj132, obj133 at pos13. Every position, such as pos1, pos2, and so forth, is located in respective cities like cit1, cit2, and the cities have corresponding airports (e.g., apt1 in cit1, apt2 in cit2). The objective is to rearrange the packages across these locations based on the specified target conditions: obj112 should be at pos8, obj103 at apt13, obj42 at pos11, and so forth. This list continues until obj101, which needs to be at pos1. The challenge lies in efficiently achieving these desired end locations for all listed packages.
