In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane only if both are present at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or an airplane, it is no longer considered to be at that location. To unload a package from a truck, the truck and the package must be at the intended location, and the package must be inside the truck. The same rule applies to unloading a package from an airplane. Once unloaded, the package is at the new location and no longer inside the vehicle. You can drive a truck between two locations within the same city only if the truck is initially at the first location. After the truck has driven, it will be found at the second location. When it comes to flying, airplanes can only travel between designated airports. The airplane must be at the departure airport, and upon arrival, it will be at the destination airport. These actions and rules govern the movement and placement of packages throughout the logistics network.
