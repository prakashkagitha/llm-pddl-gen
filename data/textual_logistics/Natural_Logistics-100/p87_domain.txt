In the Logistics game, your objective is to move packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions at your disposal: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location, or similarly, load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded into a truck or an airplane, it is no longer considered to be at that location. To change a package's location, you can unload it from a truck or airplane, given that the vehicle carrying it is present at the desired location. Once a package is unloaded, it is at the location and no longer in the truck or airplane. Additionally, driving a truck from one location to another is only possible if the truck is initially at the first location, and both locations are within the same city. After the drive, the truck will be located in the second city. Flying airplanes operates between airports: you can fly an airplane from one airport to another, provided it starts at the first airport. After flying, the airplane will reach its destination airport.
