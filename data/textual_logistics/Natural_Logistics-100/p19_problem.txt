In the Logistics game, we have several packages and vehicles situated across different cities and locations. Initially, the packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are located at position pos1, where truck tru1 is also stationed. In city cit2, at position pos2, packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 along with truck tru2 are present. Similarly, at position pos3 in city cit3, packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are found with truck tru3. Over in city cit4, position pos4, packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 accompany truck tru4, and finally, in city cit5, position pos5, packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 are there with truck tru5. We also have two airplanes: apn1 at airport apt1 in city cit1 and apn2 stationed at airport apt5 in city cit5. The goal is to deliver the packages to specific locations: obj33 and obj31 are to remain at pos3, obj22 is to be moved to pos3, obj13 should be at airport apt2, obj43 and obj41 need to be at airport apt1, obj51 and obj21 should be relocated to position pos4, obj53 should be delivered to airport apt5, obj11 should be at pos4, obj42 and obj52 should be transported to pos1, obj12 should end up at airport apt3, and obj32 should be moved to airport apt4. Let us achieve this distribution through strategic transportation and placement of these packages and vehicles.
