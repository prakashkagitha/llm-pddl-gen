The Logistics game consists of several packages, trucks, cities, locations, airports, and airplanes. There are thirty-three packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, obj83, obj91, obj92, obj93, obj101, obj102, obj103, obj111, obj112, and obj113. Eleven trucks are available: tru1 to tru11. The game involves eleven cities: cit1 to cit11, and each city has a position (pos1 to pos11) and an airport (apt1 to apt11). There are three airplanes: apn1, apn2, and apn3. Initially, apn1 is at airport apt7, apn2 is at apt3, and apn3 is at apt1. The trucks and packages are distributed as follows: tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1; tru2 and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2; tru3 and packages obj31, obj32, and obj33 are at pos3; tru4 and packages obj41, obj42, and obj43 are at pos4; tru5 and packages obj51, obj52, and obj53 are at pos5; tru6 and packages obj61, obj62, and obj63 are at pos6; tru7 and packages obj71, obj72, and obj73 are at pos7; tru8 and packages obj81, obj82, and obj83 are at pos8; tru9 and packages obj91, obj92, and obj93 are at pos9; tru10 and packages obj101, obj102, and obj103 are at pos10; tru11 and packages obj111, obj112, and obj113 are at pos11. Each city's position and airport belong to that city, for example, pos1 and apt1 are in cit1, and so on, until pos11 and apt11 are in cit11. The goal is to redistribute the packages to specific destinations: obj43 to apt4, obj73 to pos4, obj91 to apt8, obj32 to pos10, obj82 to apt6, obj42 to apt11, obj13 to apt5, obj22 to apt8, obj112 to apt6, obj51 to apt2, obj53 to pos8, obj102 to pos1, obj92 to apt6, obj83 to pos2, obj41 to apt5, obj61 to apt9, obj71 to pos5, obj23 to pos6, obj93 to pos4, obj63 to pos10, obj72 to apt7, obj113 to apt9, obj62 to pos11, obj33 to apt4, obj12 to apt7, obj21 to apt11, obj101 to pos1, obj52 to apt8, obj31 to apt1, obj111 to pos8, and obj11 to pos4.
