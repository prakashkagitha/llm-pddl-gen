In the Logistics game, your objective is to efficiently transport packages between various locations using available vehicles, such as trucks and airplanes. To achieve this, you can execute the following actions: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, provided both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a designated location if the package and the airplane are both there. Once a package is loaded onto a vehicle, it is no longer considered to be at the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle is currently at the location where you wish to unload, and the package must be inside the vehicle. After unloading, the package is effectively at the new location and no longer inside the vehicle. Driving a truck from one point to another is permissible only if the truck is currently at the starting location and both locations reside within the same city. Upon completing the drive, the truck will be positioned at the new location and no longer at the starting point. Air travel is restricted to flights between airports, and the airplane must be stationed at the departing airport. Successfully completing a flight means the airplane is now at the destination airport and no longer at the departure airport. With these operations, strategically coordinate your logistics to move packages to their intended destinations.
