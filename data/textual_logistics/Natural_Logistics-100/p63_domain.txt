In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations. Here's how you can manage the logistics: You can load a package onto a truck at a particular location, provided the package and the truck are both present there. Similarly, packages can be loaded onto an airplane, but again, only if both are at the same location. Once loaded onto a truck or an airplane, the package is no longer at the original location. Unloading works similarly; you can only do so if the truck or airplane carrying the package is at the destination location. After being unloaded, the package is considered to be at that location and is no longer inside the vehicle or aircraft. When it comes to moving vehicles, trucks can be driven between locations within the same city. To do this, the truck must start at the first location and will arrive at the second, effectively changing its location within that city. Airplanes, on the other hand, can fly between two airports. The plane must be at the departure airport initially and, after the flight, it will be at the arrival airport. This set of rules defines how you can control trucks and airplanes to efficiently manage the distribution of packages across different locations.
