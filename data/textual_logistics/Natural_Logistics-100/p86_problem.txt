In the Logistics game, we have the following initial setup: There are packages designated from package1 to package17 and cities labeled from city1 to city23. Each city has two locations - for instance, city1 has city1-1 and city1-2, with city1-2 serving as the airport. We also have trucks ranging from truck1 to truck23, and airplanes labeled plane1 to plane4. The initial positions are as follows: plane4 is at the airport in city11, plane3 is at the airport in city13, plane2 is at the airport in city18, and plane1 is at the airport in city16. Each truck is stationed at location '-1' in their respective cities, e.g., truck23 is at city23-1, truck22 at city22-1, and so on. The packages are distributed in different cities and locations to start: package17 is at city8-2, package16 at city13-2, package15 at city15-2, continuing similarly for the rest of the packages through package1. Our objective is to rearrange the packages so that package17 ends up at city3-1, package16 at city4-2, package15 at city19-1, package14 at city9-1, and so on, until package1 remains at its original position at city13-1. This is the challenge we face in the Logistics game.
