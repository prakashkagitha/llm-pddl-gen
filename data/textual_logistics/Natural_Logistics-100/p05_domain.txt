In the Logistics game, your goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck or airplane, but you must ensure that both the package and the vehicle are already at the same location. Once loaded, the package is considered to be inside the vehicle and is no longer at the original location. Similarly, to unload a package from a truck or airplane, the vehicle must be at the specified location, and the package must be inside it. After unloading, the package is at the new location and is no longer inside the vehicle. Driving a truck involves moving it from one location to another within the same city. However, make sure the truck is present at the starting location before the move, and remember, the truck can only travel to locations within the same city. After driving, the truck will be situated at the new location. Flying an airplane involves transporting it from one airport to another. Ensure that the airplane is at the initial airport before taking off. Once the flight is complete, the airplane will be located at the destination airport. These actions and conditions guide how you can efficiently move packages from one place to another within the game.
