In the Logistics game, your task is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes, while adhering to specific operational rules. You can perform the following actions: Load a package onto a truck at a certain location, provided both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, load a package onto an airplane at a given location, as long as both the package and the airplane are at that location. You can unload a package from a truck when both the truck and the package are at the desired location. Likewise, you can unload a package from an airplane if both the airplane and the package are at the location. Driving a truck between two locations within the same city is possible only if the truck is initially at the first location. After driving, the truck will be stationed at the second location. You can fly an airplane from one airport to another only if the airplane is located at the starting airport. Upon flying, the airplane will reach and remain at the destination airport.
