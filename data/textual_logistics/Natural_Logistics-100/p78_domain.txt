In the Logistics game, you need to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions at your disposal: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, but this requires that both the package and the vehicle are present at that location. Once the package is loaded, it is considered to be inside the truck or airplane, and is no longer at the original location. To unload a package, both the truck or airplane and the package must be at the designated location, and once unloaded, the package will be at that location and not in the vehicle anymore. Driving a truck from one location to another is only possible if the truck is already at the starting location, and both locations must be within the same city. After the drive, the truck will be at the new location and not at the previous one. Flying involves moving an airplane from one airport to another. The airplane must be at the initial airport, and after the flight, it will be located at the destination airport.
