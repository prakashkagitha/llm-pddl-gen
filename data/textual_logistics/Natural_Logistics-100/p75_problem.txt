In the Logistics game, we begin with a setup involving various packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. Initially, we have 39 packages labeled from obj11 to obj133, 13 trucks named tru1 to tru13, 13 cities known as cit1 to cit13, and several locations, both positional and airport, across these cities. Additionally, there are four airplanes, apn1 through apn4, which are stationed at specific airports for initial setup. Specifically, apn1 is positioned at apt12, apn2 at apt7, apn3 at apt1, and apn4 at apt2. Each city hosts a position and an airport, for example, pos1 and apt1 are within cit1. Correspondingly, each truck, along with its respective packages, is located at a position within a city. For instance, tru1 and packages obj11, obj12, obj13 are located at pos1 within cit1.

The objective of the game is to move these packages to specific locations. Notably, obj123 should arrive at apt6, obj23 needs to be moved to pos6, and obj121 should find its destination at pos2. Similarly, obj101 is to be transported to apt8, obj113 to pos6, and obj21 to apt8. Additionally, obj132 is destined for apt5, while obj13 should remain at pos1, and obj62 must be relocated to pos12. Moreover, obj63 will be at apt6, while obj133 stays at pos1, and obj33 is to be transferred to apt7. Further movements include obj22 reaching apt4, obj92 going to pos6, and obj111 required at pos2. obj42 should be moved to pos9, obj52 needs repositioning at pos11, while obj53 is headed to apt9. The placement of obj122 is targeted at apt11, and obj82 should be at pos8. Meanwhile, obj81 will be transferred to apt6, obj93 must end up at pos13, and obj73 is assigned to pos8. Moreover, obj83 is designated for pos4, obj72 to apt11, and obj31 to apt7. Necessary relocations continue with obj91 at pos9, obj61 at apt7, and obj43 to pos6. Furthermore, obj51 will be situated at apt10, obj41 at apt4, and obj103 at apt12. On the other, obj32 needs to reach pos5, obj112 is set for pos2, and obj131 moves to pos11. Finally, we expect obj12 to reach apt1, obj11 to stay at pos4, and obj71 to be placed at pos10.
