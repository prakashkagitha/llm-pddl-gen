The Logistics game presents us with the following initial scenario: We have six packages, appropriately named package1 through package6. Additionally, there are five cities, numbered city1 through city5. Within these cities, several trucks and airplanes are available for transportation. Specifically, there are fourteen trucks, labeled truck1 through truck14, and two airplanes, plane1 and plane2, ready to be deployed. Each city contains specific locations that may serve as destinations for the packages: locations such as cityX-1, cityX-2 for standard locations, and cityX-3 for airports, where 'X' corresponds to the city number. Each of these locations is situated within their respective cities. Currently, plane2 is stationed at city3's airport (city3-3), while plane1 is parked at city5's airport (city5-3). The trucks are dispersed across various city locations as follows: truck14 and truck6 are both at city5-1, truck13 and truck5 at city4-1, truck12 is at city3-2, truck11 at city2-2, truck10 and truck3 at city1-2, truck9, truck8, and truck2 at city3-1, truck7 at city1-3, truck4 at city1-1, and truck1 is located at city2-1. As for the packages, package6 is currently located at city4-2, package5 at city4's airport (city4-3), package4 at city1-1, package3 sits at city3-2, package2 is at city5-1, and package1 at city4-1. The objective is to transport these packages to their intended destinations: package6 needs to be delivered to city1's airport (city1-3), package5 to city5-2, package4 to city3-1, package3 to city4-2, package2 to city2's airport (city2-3), and package1 to city2-2. Our task is to use the available vehicles to achieve these delivery goals efficiently.
