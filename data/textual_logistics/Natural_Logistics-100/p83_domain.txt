In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using different modes of transport. You have several actions at your disposal: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, but only if both the package and the truck are present at that location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane, provided that both the package and the airplane are at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered as no longer being at the location. You can unload a package from a truck or airplane, but this can only occur if the truck or airplane is present at the location and the package is inside it. After unloading, the package is now at the location and no longer inside the vehicle. Driving a truck from one location to another within the same city is possible, given that the truck is currently at the starting location and both locations are situated within the same city. Following the drive, the truck is now present at the destination and is no longer at the starting point. Flying an airplane is only permissible between two airports, with the condition that the airplane is present at the departing airport. Once the airplane takes off, it arrives at the destination airport, ceasing to be at the starting point. These actions and constraints define the logistics task of moving packages between locations efficiently.
