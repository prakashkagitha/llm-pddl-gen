In the Logistics game, the objective is to efficiently transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions at your disposal to facilitate this movement. You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are present at the same location, and similarly, load it onto an airplane if the package and airplane are co-located. Once you load a package onto a vehicle, it is considered to have left the location and is now within that vehicle. Conversely, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane, provided the vehicle containing the package is stationed at the target location. This action makes the package available at the location, removing it from the vehicle. Driving a truck requires that the truck is at the origin location, and both the starting point and the destination lie within the same city. Successful completion of this action means the truck is now at the destination location. Regarding air travel, you can fly an airplane between two airports, under the condition that the airplane starts at the initial airport. After flying, the airplane is positioned at the destination airport, having left the starting airport.
