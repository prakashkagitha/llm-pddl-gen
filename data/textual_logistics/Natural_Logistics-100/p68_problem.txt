In the initial setup of this logistics challenge, we have packages labeled from obj11 to obj123, which are spread across various locations. Additionally, there are trucks from tru1 to tru12 and three airplanes, apn1, apn2, and apn3 involved in this logistics operation. The scenario includes twelve cities, each having a position and an airport as a location. Specifically, apn1 is stationed at the airport in city 11, apn2 at the airport in city 12, and apn3 at the airport in city 7. Each truck and package also begins at a specific position: for example, tru1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at position pos1 in city 1, tru2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are situated at position pos2 in city 2, and this pattern continues similarly for all twelve trucks and positions. Each position and airport location is designated to be within a specific city, such as pos1 and apt1 in city 1, pos2 and apt2 in city 2, continuing sequentially up to city 12. Our goal is an intricate logistics operation that requires rearranging these packages to reach specific target locations. For instance, obj13 should remain at pos1, while obj53 needs to be relocated to the airport in city 1. We need obj21 to reach the airport in city 9, obj32 to be delivered to pos12, and similar specific targets for each package listed, including obj122 arriving at pos7, obj72 being transferred to pos2, and obj111 staying at pos11. This complex scenario involves carefully orchestrating vehicles and planning the most efficient route for each package to achieve the end state as outlined in the goal.
