In the Logistics game, the initial setup includes the following: There are two packages (obj11 and obj12) currently located at position pos1, and another package, obj13, is also at pos1. These are part of city cit1. Meanwhile, packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at position pos2 in city cit2. We have two trucks: tru1 is at pos1, and tru2 is at pos2. Additionally, there are two airports, apt1 in city cit1 and apt2 in city cit2, with an airplane, apn1, stationed at apt2. Our objective is to move obj12 to airport apt2, obj13 to airport apt1, obj21 to airport apt2, and obj11 to position pos2. The game requires strategic movement of trucks and the airplane to achieve these goals within the given cities and locations.
