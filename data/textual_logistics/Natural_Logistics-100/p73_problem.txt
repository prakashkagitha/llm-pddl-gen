In the Logistics game, we have several packages and vehicles initially located at different locations. There are packages named obj11 through obj133 and these are located across various positions labeled pos1, pos2, ..., pos13. We also have a series of trucks, tru1 through tru13, which are stationed at these positions. Further, the game includes four airplanes, apn1 through apn4, currently parked at airports apt12, apt8, apt5, and apt6 respectively. The setting includes cities cit1 through cit13, each containing a position and an airport, creating a map of interrelated locations. The objective is to reassign the location of these packages as follows: Move obj62 to apt11, obj41 to apt1, obj53 to pos10, obj92 to apt2, obj51 to pos9, obj93 to apt6, obj103 to pos2, obj132 to pos6, obj31 to pos3, obj122 to pos5, obj123 to pos13, obj13 to pos11, obj42 to pos3, obj22 to pos10, obj133 to apt7, obj91 to pos7, obj52 to apt4, obj102 to pos5, obj71 to apt6, obj111 to pos7, obj43 to pos2, obj101 to pos2, obj82 to apt10, obj32 to pos5, obj61 to apt7, obj81 to apt7, obj72 to pos11, obj83 to pos7, obj121 to pos7, obj112 to pos13, obj73 to apt10, obj11 to pos4, obj33 to pos3, obj113 to pos3, obj21 to apt10, obj131 to apt5, and obj23 to pos4. This reassigning of package locations is to be completed to achieve the game's objective.
