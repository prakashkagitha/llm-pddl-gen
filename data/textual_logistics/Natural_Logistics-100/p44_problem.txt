In the Logistics game, I start with several packages and vehicles. Specifically, I have these packages: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, obj63, obj71, obj72, obj73, obj81, obj82, and obj83. The vehicles are trucks, tru1 to tru8, and airplanes apn1 and apn2. There are eight cities, cit1 to cit8, each containing a location pos1 to pos8 and an airport apt1 to apt8. Initially, apn1 is positioned at apt4, and apn2 at apt5. Truck tru1 is stationed at pos1 along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. True2 is at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. This pattern continues, with each truck being at its respective position (tru3 at pos3, tru4 at pos4, etc.), and each position holding its respective packages (obj31, obj32, obj33 at pos3, etc.). Each position and airport corresponds to a particular city (pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and so on). My goal is to move these packages so that they end up at specific locations: obj11 to pos6, obj51 to pos4, obj43 to apt1, obj41 to pos2, obj81 to apt6, obj73 to apt2, obj61 and obj62 to apt8, obj33 to pos2, obj82 to pos4, obj63 and obj53 to their destinations at pos6 and apt8 respectively, obj22 to pos2, obj71 to apt6, obj72 to apt1, obj32 to pos2, obj13 to apt3, obj83 to apt5, obj12 to pos4, obj52 to pos6, obj23 and obj31 to pos4, obj42 to apt2, and finally obj21 to apt4.
