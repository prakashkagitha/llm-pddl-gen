In the Logistics game, we start with the following initial conditions: We have six packages, labeled obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, and obj23. There are two trucks, named tru1 and tru2, and a single airplane called apn1. The game involves two cities, cit1 and cit2. Within cit1, there are two locations: a general location, pos1, and an airport, apt1. In cit2, there are also two locations: a general location, pos2, and an airport, apt2. Initially, the airplane, apn1, is stationed at airport apt1 in cit1. Truck tru1 is located at pos1 in cit1, carrying packages obj11, obj12, and obj13. Similarly, truck tru2 is located at pos2 in cit2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23. The desired goal is to have package obj11 remain at pos1 in cit1, to transport obj12 to apt1, to move obj13 and obj21 to pos2 in cit2, to get obj22 to apt2 in cit2, and to leave obj23 at pos2 in cit2.
