In the Logistics game, your objective is to efficiently transport packages between various locations. To achieve this, you have several actions at your disposal: 

1. You can load a package onto a truck when both the package and the truck are present at a specific location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both are at the same spot. 

2. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered off the ground and no longer at the original loading location. 

3. To unload a package, ensure that both the truck or airplane and the package are at the unloading location. Successfully unloading the package places it at the location and removes it from the vehicle. 

4. Trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city. To drive a truck, make sure it starts at the first location, and remember, once the truck arrives, it leaves the previous location. 

5. Airplanes can be flown between two airports. The airplane must be stationed at the departure airport to initiate the flight. Upon arrival, the airplane departs from its previous airport location. 

These rules and actions set the framework for effectively managing and transporting packages in this logistics scenario.
