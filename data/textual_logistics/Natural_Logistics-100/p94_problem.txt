In the Logistics game, let's start by understanding the initial setup: We have three packages - package1, package2, and package3. There are five cities - city1, city2, city3, city4, and city5. Each city has a specific location, denoted as cityX-1, and an airport, denoted as cityX-2. Additionally, we have five trucks - truck1 through truck5, and two airplanes - plane1 and plane2. Each of these vehicles has a starting location. Truck1 begins at the location city1-1, truck2 at city2-1, truck3 at city3-1, truck4 at city4-1, and truck5 at city5-1. Our airplanes, plane2 and plane1, are stationed at airports city1-2 and city2-2, respectively. As for our packages, package3 is initially at city1-1, package2 at city1-2, and package1 at city4-1. The objective is simple: we want to rearrange the packages so that package3 ends up at city1-2, package2 at city1-1, and package1 at city3-2.
