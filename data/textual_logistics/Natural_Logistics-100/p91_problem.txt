In the world of the Logistics game, we have an initial setup involving packages, cities, trucks, and airplanes. Specifically, package23 through package1 are scattered across distinct locations. We have three major city hubs: city1, city2, and city3, each with various locations and airports within them. Our fleet consists of five trucks, named truck1 to truck5, and seven airplanes, designated plane1 to plane7. Each vehicle is stationed at specific locations within these cities. The task at hand involves relocating packages to their designated destinations. For example, package23 needs to be transported to city2-3, while package22 should remain at city1-5. Other packages need to be carefully placed according to the requirements, such as transferring package21 to city1-6 and package20 to city1-1. Our end goal is to ensure all specified packages are accurately positioned at their respective target locations, thus completing the logistics challenge.
