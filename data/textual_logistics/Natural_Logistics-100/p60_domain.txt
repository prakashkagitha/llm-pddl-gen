In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane if both the package and the vehicle are present at the same location. Once the package is loaded, it will no longer be considered at that location. You are able to unload a package from a truck or airplane only if the vehicle is at the location and the package is still inside it. After unloading, the package will be regarded as being at that location and won't be in the vehicle anymore. You can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, provided that the truck is initially at the starting location. Once driven, the truck will be at the destination location and no longer at the starting point. Similarly, you can fly an airplane from one airport to another if the airplane is situated at the departure airport. After the flight, the airplane will be at the arrival airport and will not be at the departure airport anymore.
