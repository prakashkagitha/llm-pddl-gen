In the Logistics game, your goal is to move packages between different locations using available transportation methods. Here are the actions you can perform to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, provided both the package and the truck are present there. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane at a location if both the package and airplane are available at that spot. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it leaves the location and is considered onboard the vehicle. To unload a package from a truck, the truck needs to be at the specified location, and the package must be inside the truck. The same applies to unloading an airplane; both must be at the location with the package inside the airplane. Once unloaded, the package is at the location and no longer in the vehicle. Driving a truck requires that the truck is at the starting location, and both the departure and destination locations need to be within the same city. After driving, the truck moves to the new location and is no longer at the starting point. For air travel, an airplane can only fly between two airports. The airplane must start at the first airport, and after flying, it arrives and stays at the second airport, leaving the first one behind.
