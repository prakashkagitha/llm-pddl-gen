In the Logistics game, we initially have a series of packages and vehicles distributed across different cities and locations. The packages, identified as obj11 through obj83, are placed in positions pos1 through pos8. The trucks, tru1 through tru8, are stationed at their corresponding positions, and airplanes, apn1 and apn2, are located at airports apt8 and apt3, respectively. Each position and airport is situated within a specific city, cit1 through cit8. Initially, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1 with tru1; obj21, obj22, and obj23 are at pos2 with tru2, and this pattern follows logically through obj83, which is at pos8 with tru8. Our objective is to rearrange these packages so that specific ones reach designated airports or positions: obj81 should be at apt1, while obj22 and obj23 should move to apt8. Similarly, obj53 needs to go to pos1, obj62 to apt7, and so on, with each package having a final target location. We need to ensure that all specified packages are correctly delivered to their desired locations to succeed in this logistics challenge.
