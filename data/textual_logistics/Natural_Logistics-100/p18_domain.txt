In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using different modes of transportation. Here's what you can do: You can load a package onto a truck or airplane, but both the package and the vehicle must be at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a vehicle, it leaves its initial location and resides within the vehicle. Conversely, unloading a package requires that both the package and vehicle are present at the target location. Once unloaded, the package is again situated at the new location. When it comes to moving vehicles, trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, provided that the truck is starting from the first location. After driving, the truck relocates to its new destination. For longer distances between cities, airplanes can fly from one airport to another, with the precondition that the plane is currently at the starting airport. After the flight, the airplane arrives at the destination airport.
