In this logistics scenario, we begin with several packages, vehicles, and locations. The packages are: obj11, obj12, and obj13, all currently located at pos1, and obj21, obj22, and obj23, all currently located at pos2. There are two trucks: tru1 positioned at pos1, and tru2 positioned at pos2. We also have two cities: cit1 and cit2, each containing a set of locations. Within cit1, there are pos1 and an airport, apt1. Likewise, within cit2, there are pos2 and an airport, apt2. An airplane, apn1, is stationed at the airport apt2. Our objective is to relocate the packages such that obj12 remains at pos1 along with obj23, obj11 is transferred to apt1, obj22 is also moved to apt1, while obj13 and obj21 should both be at pos2.
