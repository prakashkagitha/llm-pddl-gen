In the Logistics game, the initial conditions are as follows: There are 21 packages labeled from package1 to package21. There are 8 cities, numbered city1 through city8. Additionally, the game involves 28 trucks, designated from truck1 to truck28, and 4 planes, named plane1 through plane4. Each city contains a specific location, with city1 to city8 having locations city1-1 to city8-1 respectively, and each city has an airport labeled city1-2 to city8-2, which is located within the respective city. Initially, plane4 is stationed at the airport in city5, plane3 at the airport in city7, plane2 at the airport in city3, and plane1 at the airport in city1. Trucks are scattered across various locations, like truck28 being in city8-1, truck27 in city7-1, down to truck1, which is stationed at city5-2. Packages are also distributed among different city locations; for example, package21 is at city3-1, package20 is at city3-1, and package1 is at city1-1. The ultimate goal is to redistribute these packages to new destinations: package21 needs to reach city5-2, package20 should be at city2-2, and so on, until package1 finds its way to city8-2. The strategic challenge is to maneuver all resources to meet these package delivery objectives.
