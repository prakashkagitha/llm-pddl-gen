In the Logistics game, we start with the following initial conditions: There are nine packages, identified as obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, and obj33. We have three trucks named tru1, tru2, and tru3. Additionally, there are three cities cited as cit1, cit2, and cit3, each with two locations, pos1 and apt1 in cit1, pos2 and apt2 in cit2, and pos3 and apt3 in cit3. Each city also has an airport, specifically apt1, apt2, and apt3. A single airplane, apn1, is currently stationed at airport apt1. Truck tru1, along with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13, is located at pos1. Meanwhile, truck tru2, and packages obj21, obj22, and obj23 are situated at pos2, and truck tru3, along with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33, are at pos3. The goal of the game is to ensure the following package deliveries: obj22 should remain at pos2, obj33 needs to be moved to apt1, obj12 is to be delivered to pos2, obj13 must reach apt3, obj31 should arrive at apt2, obj23 is to be transferred to apt1, and obj32 has to be relocated to pos1.
