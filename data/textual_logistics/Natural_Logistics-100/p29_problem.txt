In the Logistics game, the initial setup is as follows: obj11, obj12, obj13, obj21, obj22, obj23, obj31, obj32, obj33, obj41, obj42, obj43, obj51, obj52, obj53, obj61, obj62, and obj63 are designated as packages. There are several trucks labeled tru1 through tru6, and these operate in various cities described as cit1 through cit6. Each city contains two locations, a position (pos1 to pos6) and an airport (apt1 to apt6). Airport locations are apt1 at cit1, apt2 at cit2, apt3 at cit3, apt4 at cit4, apt5 at cit5, and apt6 at cit6. Additionally, there are two airplanes, apn1 and apn2, parked at airports apt3 and apt2, respectively. Initially, all trucks are stationed at their respective positions: tru1 at pos1 with packages obj11, obj12, and obj13; tru2 at pos2 with packages obj21, obj22, and obj23; tru3 at pos3 with packages obj31, obj32, and obj33; tru4 at pos4 with packages obj41, obj42, and obj43; tru5 at pos5 with packages obj51, obj52, and obj53; and tru6 at pos6 with packages obj61, obj62, and obj63. Each position is associated with a corresponding city: pos1 in cit1, pos2 in cit2, pos3 in cit3, pos4 in cit4, pos5 in cit5, and pos6 in cit6. The goal is to relocate specific packages to designated locations: move obj13 to pos5, obj52 to pos6, obj12 to apt2, obj53 to apt3, obj63 to pos6, obj21 to pos5, obj33 to pos1, obj51 to pos3, obj31 to apt3, obj42 to apt3, obj61 to pos6, obj11 to apt3, obj32 to pos1, obj43 to pos6, obj62 to apt6, obj41 to pos1, and obj23 to pos4.
