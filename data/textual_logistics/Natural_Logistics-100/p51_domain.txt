In the Logistics game, your task is to transport packages from one location to another using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions available to manage this process. To move a package, you can load it onto a truck or an airplane but remember, both the package and the vehicle must be at the same starting location. Once you load a package, it's no longer available at that location, as it becomes part of the truck or airplane's cargo. Unloading requires that the vehicle, whether a truck or an airplane, reaches the desired destination while carrying the package; only then can you unload it, making it available at the new location. Driving a truck is restricted within city limits â€“ both the departure and arrival locations must be in the same city, and you can only begin driving if the truck is at the first location. When driving a truck from one point to another, once successful, the truck is relocated to the new destination. Flying is reserved for travel between airports, with the airplane needing to be stationed at the first airport before take-off. Successfully flying the airplane positions it at the destination airport, effectively moving the airplane and any cargo it carries to this new site. Use these actions strategically to accomplish the movement of packages efficiently across your logistical network.
