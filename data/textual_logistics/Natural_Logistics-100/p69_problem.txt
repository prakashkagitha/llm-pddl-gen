Initial setup for the logistics game includes 36 packages labeled from obj11 to obj123 and 12 trucks labeled from tru1 to tru12. There are also 12 cities each with a position and airport location. Every airplane (apn1, apn2, and apn3) is initially stationed at apt12 or apt7. Each position from pos1 to pos12 is located within its corresponding city, and similarly, each airport (apt1 to apt12) is located in its respective city. Specifically, the packages start at various locations; for example, obj11, obj12, and obj13 are at pos1, with the corresponding truck tru1. The goal is to rearrange these packages such that specific packages end up at certain locations. For instance, obj81 needs to be at pos1, obj62 at pos5, obj123 at pos7, obj42 at apt12, and obj112 at apt6. The comprehensive list outlines destinations for all packages ensuring proper distribution and logistics management to achieve the described end positions for each package.
