The Logistics game involves transporting packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here are the actions you can perform: You can load a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same location. Similarly, you can load a package onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are situated at the same location. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or an airplane, it is considered to have left the original location. To unload a package from a truck, both the truck and package must be at the same location, and this also applies to unloading from an airplane. Once unloaded, the package is placed at the location and is no longer inside the truck or airplane. Driving a truck from one location to another requires that the truck be present at the starting location, and both locations must lie within the same city. After driving, the truck is located at the destination and no longer at the starting point. Airplanes can be flown between airports, provided the airplane is initially located at the departure airport. After flying, the airplane will be located at the destination airport, leaving the departure airport.
