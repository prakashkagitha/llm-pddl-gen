In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions available to achieve this: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane at a specific location, provided both the package and the vehicle are present there. When a package is loaded onto a truck or an airplane, it is considered to be no longer at the location. To unload a package, the truck or airplane must be at the specified location, and the package must be inside. Once unloaded, the package is now at that location and no longer inside the vehicle. Driving a truck involves moving it between two places within the same city, but the truck must begin its journey at the starting location. After driving, the truck will be at the destination and not at the original location. Flying involves transporting an airplane between two airports. The airplane must be stationed at the departure airport to conduct a flight. Once flown, the airplane arrives at the new airport and is no longer at the initial one. Each action must be executed following these rules to assure packages reach their intended destinations efficiently.
