I want to make cocktail1. To do this, I can use shaker shaker1, my left hand, my right hand, shot glass shot1, shot glass shot2, ingredient ingredient1, ingredient ingredient2, ingredient ingredient3, dispenser dispenser1, dispenser dispenser2, and dispenser dispenser3. The shaker has levels l0, l1, and l2. 
As initial conditions, I have that shaker1 is on the table, shot1 is on the table, shot2 is on the table, dispenser1 dispenses ingredient1, dispenser2 dispenses ingredient2, dispenser3 dispenses ingredient3, shaker1 is clean, shot1 is clean, shot2 is clean, shaker1 is empty, shot1 is empty, shot2 is empty, my left hand is empty, my right hand is empty, the empty level of shaker1 is l0, the next layer after l0 is l1, the next layer after l1 is l2, the first part of cocktail1 is ingredient1, and the second part of cocktail1 is ingredient3. 
My goal is to have that shot1 contains cocktail1.
