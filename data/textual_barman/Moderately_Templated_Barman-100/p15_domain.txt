I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    I can only grasp a container if it is on the table and my hand is empty.
    Once I am grasping a container the container is not on the table, my hand is not empty, and my hand is holding the container.
    I can only leave a container if my hand is holding the container.
    Once I leave the container, my hand is not holding the container, my hand is empty and the container is on the table.
    When I fill a shot glass with an ingredient, I can only hold one shot glass at a time, while my other hand is empty. I must use the dispenser that contains that ingredient, and my shot glass must be clean and empty.
    Once I fill my shot glass with an ingredient the shot glass is not empty, the shot glass contains the ingredient, the shot glass is not clean and the shot glass has used that ingredient.
    When I refill a shot glass with an ingredient, I can only hold one shot glass at a time, while my other hand is empty. I must use the dispenser that contains that ingredient, and my shot glass must be empty and used only by that ingredient.
    Once I refill my shot glass with an ingredient, the shot glass is not empty and contains that ingredient.
    When I empty a shot glass, my hand must be holding a shot glass and the shot glass must contain a beverage.
    Once I empty a shot glass, the shot glass does not contain a beverage and is empty.
    When I clean a shot glass, I can only hold one shot glass at a time and my other hand is empty. My shot glass must be empty and was used by a beverage.
    Once I clean a shot glass, the shot glass is no longer used by a beverage and is clean.
    I can only pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a clean shaker if I holding a shot glass and the shot glass contains that ingredient. The shaker must be empty and clean, and the shaker is filled to a specific level.
    Once I pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a clean shaker the shot glass does not contain that ingredient and is empty. The shaker contains that ingredient and is not empty and not clean. The shaker has not been shaken and the shaker is now filled to the next level.
    I can only pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a used shaker if I am holding a shot glass that contains that ingredient and the shaker is not yet shaked and filled to a certain level.
    Once I pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a used shaker the shot glass does not contain that ingredient and is empty. The shaker contains that ingredient and is now filled to the next level.
    I can only empty a shaker if I am holding a shaker and the shaker contains a cocktail and has been shaked. The shaker must be filled to a certain level.
    Once I empty a shaker, the shaker is not shaked and is not filled to that level. It is now filled to the empty level and the shaker is empty.
    I can only clean a shaker if I am only holding one shaker and my other hand is empty, and my shaker is empty.
    Once I clean a shaker, the shaker is cleaned.
    I can only shake a shaker if I only holding one shaker and my other hand is empty. The shaker contains both ingredients and both ingredients are part of the cocktail, and the shaker has not been shaken yet.
    Once I shake the shaker, the shaker is not unshaked and the shaker does not contain both ingredients. The shaker is shaked and contains a cocktail.
    I can only pour a beverage from a shaker to shot glass if I am holding the shaker, the shaker contains a beverage and the shaker has been shaken. The shot glass must be empty and clean, and the shaker must be filled to a certain level.
    Once I pour the beverage from shaker to shot glass, the shot glass is not clean and not empty. The shot glass contains the beverage and has been used by the beverage. The level in the shaker has descreased to the previous level.
