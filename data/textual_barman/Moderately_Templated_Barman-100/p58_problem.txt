I want to make cocktail1, and cocktail2. To do this, I can use shaker shaker1, my left hand, my right hand, shot glass shot1, shot glass shot2, shot glass shot3, ingredient ingredient1, ingredient ingredient2, dispenser dispenser1, and dispenser dispenser2. The shaker has levels l0, l1, and l2.

My goal is to have that shot1 contains cocktail2, and shot2 contains cocktail1.
