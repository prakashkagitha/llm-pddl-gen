I want to make 2 cocktails. To do this, I have 3 shot glasses and 1 shaker, which are all clean, empty and on the table. The shaker has 3 levels and can contain different levels of ingredients, starting with being empty. When pouring into a shaker, the level always increases to the next level. When pouring out of the shaker, the level decreases to the previous level. I also have 4 dispensers that dispense 4 ingredients. The first dispenser dispenses the first ingredient, the second dispenser dispenses the second ingredient, the third dispenser dispenses the third ingredient, and the fourth dispenser dispenses the fourth ingredient. I can use both of my hands which are currently empty. The first cocktail should contain the second ingredient and the third ingredient, and the second cocktail should contain the first ingredient and the second ingredient. In the end, I want the first cocktail in the first shot glass, and the second cocktail in the second shot glass.
