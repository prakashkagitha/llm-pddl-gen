I want to make 1 cocktail. To do this, I have 5 shot glasses and 1 shaker, which are all clean, empty and on the table. The shaker has 3 levels and can contain different levels of ingredients, starting with being empty. When pouring into a shaker, the level always increases to the next level. When pouring out of the shaker, the level decreases to the previous level. I also have 3 dispensers that dispense 3 ingredients. The first dispenser dispenses the first ingredient, the second dispenser dispenses the second ingredient, and the third dispenser dispenses the third ingredient. I can use both of my hands which are currently empty. The cocktail should contain the first ingredient and the third ingredient. In the end, I want the cocktail to be in the shot glass.
