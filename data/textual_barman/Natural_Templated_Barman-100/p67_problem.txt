I want to make 2 cocktails. To do this, I have 6 shot glasses and 1 shaker, which are all clean, empty and on the table. The shaker has 3 levels and can contain different levels of ingredients, starting with being empty. When pouring into a shaker, the level always increases to the next level. When pouring out of the shaker, the level decreases to the previous level. I also have 3 dispensers that dispense 3 ingredients. The first dispenser dispenses the first ingredient, the second dispenser dispenses the second ingredient, and the third dispenser dispenses the third ingredient. I can use both of my hands which are currently empty. The first cocktail should contain the first ingredient and the third ingredient, and the second cocktail should contain the second ingredient and the first ingredient. In the end, I want the second cocktail in the first shot glass, the first cocktail in the second shot glass, the second cocktail in the third shot glass, the first cocktail in the fourth shot glass, and the first cocktail in the fifth shot glass.
