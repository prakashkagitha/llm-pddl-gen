I am creating a cocktail from a set of ingredients. 
Here are the actions I can do: grasp a container, leave a container, fill a shot glass with with an ingredient, re-fill a shot glass with an ingredient, empty a shot glass, clean a shot glass, pour an ingredient from a shot glass to a clean shaker, pour an ingredient from a shot glass to a used shaker, empty a shaker, clean a shaker, shake a shaker and pour a cocktail from a shaker to a shot glass.
   
When I fill or re-fill a shot glass with an ingredient, or clean a shot glass I must be holding only one shot glass at a time, while my other hand is empty. 
I must use the dispenser that contains that ingredient. When I fill a shot glass my shot glass must be clean and empty. When I re-fill a shot glass my shot glass must be empty and used only by that ingredient.
When I clean a shot glass, it must be empty and was used by a beverage.
When I pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a shaker the shaker must be empty and clean.
Once I pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a clean or used shaker the shaker is now filled to the next level.
I can only pour an ingredient from a shot glass into a used shaker if the shaker is not yet shaked and filled to a certain level.
I can only empty a shaker if the shaker contains a cocktail and has been shaked.
Once I empty a shaker, it filled to the empty level.
I can only clean a shaker or shake a shaker if I am only holding one shaker and my other hand is empty. I can only clean a shaker if my shaker is empty.
I can only shake a shaker if the shaker contains both ingredients and both ingredients are part of the cocktail, and the shaker has not been shaken yet.
Once I shake the shaker, the shaker contains a cocktail.
I can only pour a beverage from a shaker to shot glass if the shot glass is empty and clean. Once I pour from the beverage, the level in the shaker drecreases to the previous level.
