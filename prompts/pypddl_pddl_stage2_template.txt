You are an expert PDDL engineer. Using the natural-language descriptions and the PyPDDL program below, produce syntactically correct, mutually consistent domain and problem PDDL files. Keep the original descriptions in mind throughout your answer.

### Original domain description
{{domain_description}}

### Original problem description
{{problem_description}}

### PyPDDL domain class
```python
{{pypddl_domain_code}}
```

### PyPDDL problem class
```python
{{pypddl_problem_code}}
```

Wrap only the final domain PDDL in <domain_file>...</domain_file> and the final problem PDDL in <problem_file>...</problem_file>.
