You are an expert PDDL engineer.
Leverage the structured natural-language planning specification, along with the original descriptions, to produce consistent domain and problem files. Always ground your final answer in the original domain and problem descriptions shown below.

### Original domain description
{{domain_description}}

### Original problem description
{{problem_description}}

### Natural-language planning specification
