Natural language planning specifications serve as a blueprint for generating the exact PDDL domain and problem files. Write in clear prose, but ensure every detail required for a faithful PDDL reconstruction is present and testable.

Overall guidance:
- Organize the specification with labeled sections so the structure is obvious without PDDL syntax.
- Use precise terminology and consistent naming; anything omitted here cannot appear in the final PDDL.
- State facts, conditions, and effects explicitly. Avoid implication, ambiguity, or narrative fluff.

Domain description must include:
- Domain title and a one-sentence overview of the scenario.
- Complete list of entity types, subtyping relations when relevant, and the role each type plays.
- Exhaustive catalog of predicates. For each predicate, name every parameter, state its type, and clarify exactly what the predicate means when true.
- Exhaustive catalog of actions. For each action, provide:
  * Action title and concise intent.
  * Parameter list with names and types, including any constraints or distinctness requirements.
  * Preconditions broken out as positive conditions (facts that must hold) and negative conditions (facts that must not hold), both referencing the predicates above.
  * Effects split into add effects (facts that become true) and delete effects (facts that cease to hold). Mention conditional effects separately if they exist.
  * Any invariants or notes needed to enforce the same logical behavior as PDDL.

Problem description must include:
- Problem title and one-sentence context linking it to the domain.
- Exhaustive list of objects, grouped by type, using the exact type names from the domain section.
- Initial state described as bullet points or sentences, each mapping directly to a predicate instance that should hold initially. Include explicit mention of facts that are false if the domain relies on them.
- Goal conditions stated explicitly, each tied to predicate instances. Distinguish between conjunctive and disjunctive goals if applicable.

Formatting conventions:
- Stick to full sentences or crisp bullet points—no raw PDDL, no code blocks, no decorative markup.
- Maintain consistent vocabulary between domain and problem sections so predicates, actions, and objects align exactly.
- If numeric fluents, temporal elements, or other advanced PDDL features are present, describe their roles, bounds, and update rules explicitly.
- The specification must be sufficient for a separate model to regenerate the original PDDL without guessing.

Abstract example (replace placeholders with the concrete content for the task at hand):
Domain Specification — DomainName
Overview: A single sentence summarizing the planning scenario.
Entity Types:
- Type1: Explanation of entities of this type and any subtype relationships.
- Type2: Explanation of entities of this type.
Predicates:
- predicate1(entity1: Type1, entity2: Type2): Meaning of the fact when true.
- predicate2(entity: Type2): Meaning of the fact when true.
Actions:
Action: Action1
Intent: Brief purpose of the action.
Parameters: entity1: Type1, entity2: Type2 (include distinctness constraints if required).
Preconditions:
- Positive: predicate1(entity1, entity2) must hold.
- Negative: predicate2(entity2) must not hold.
Effects:
- Add: predicate2(entity2) becomes true.
- Delete: predicate1(entity1, entity2) ceases to hold.
- Conditional: Describe any conditional effects explicitly, including their triggering conditions.
Action: Action2
Intent: Another representative action with its parameters, preconditions, and effects fully spelled out.

Problem Specification — ProblemName
Context: One sentence linking the problem to the domain.
Objects:
- Type1: obj1, obj2 (brief descriptions optional).
- Type2: obj3, obj4.
Initial State:
- predicate1(obj1, obj3) holds because …
- predicate2(obj4) is false (state explicitly if the domain depends on this).
Goal Conditions:
- Conjunctive goal requiring predicate2(obj3) and predicate2(obj4) to hold.
- Note disjunctions or temporal ordering if the problem includes them.
